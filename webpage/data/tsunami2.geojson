After a series of defeats of the Persians in Greece, the Greek city of Potidaea, located at the base of the Pallene (Kassandra) Peninsula in the lowest place and blocking the entrance to the peninsula, rejected Persian rule. The Persian commander Artabaz besieged Potidaea, which was surrounded by sea. After three months of siege, a strong and persistent drop in the sea level set in. The Persians saw that the coastal sand - bank had become a marsh and advanced along the Pallene coast.

Aegean Sea, eastern Greece. Island of Euboea, Gulf of Maliacus. Evidence provided by Thucidides indicates that a series of earthquakes occurred in the regions of Attica, Boeotia, Euboea in the autumn of 427 B.C. ... Several shocks in the summer and autumn of 426 B.C. occurred in the strait separating the Euboea Island from the continent. <P>According to eyewitness Demetrios Kallatianos, a significant part of the Lichades Island and the Cape Cenaeon sank under water. The shore near Orobies also sank and the coastal line shifted deep into dry land. The base of one of the peninsulas opposite the continental shore sank, and the Island of Atalanti appeared (Talantonissi). <P>After one of the earthquakes, the sea in Orobies retreated from the coastal line, but later on, coming back in the form of huge \"swelling\", it partly flooded the settlement and this was repeated many times. According to Strabo, the waves flooded the shore three times, penetrating the continental coast of Greece 3-4 miles inland. Gullies in the vicinity of Tarfi, Thronium, Thermoplyles and Daphus were flooded, and many settlements were destroyed. A similar flood took place on the Atalanti Island: here, waves caught up triremes and dragged them along the shore for more than 2 miles; another trireme was torn away from a moorage and smashed against the walls. The sea also retreated from the coast in Peparithos and Skopelos, too, but no flood accompanied this process. The wave was observed in Opus near Kiparissi. On the eastern shore of Euboea Island no waves were observed. Judging from descriptions, a tectonic collapse occurred in the strait between the Euboea Island and the continent, resulting in great seiches. One must agree with Antonopoulos that possible local landslides of friable material were not the main cause of variations in the water level in the strait.\n<P><blockquote><i>Ref #4139:</i></blockquote>\n<P>426 BC June, earthquake magnitude 7.1, intensity X, 38 deg 54 min N, 22 deg 42 min E, tsunami intensity v, event validity 4.

Pliny's dating to O1.135.4 (236 BC) seems to be chronologically inconsistent and it may be disregarded since, in an early transcription of his work, events of the 14th Olympiad were dated O1.135. <P>Most writers (e.g. Strabo and Seneca), drawing from the earliest source, Posidonius (135-151 BC) do not associate this event with an earthquake or suggest that the eruption caused any damage in Thera or elsewhere. They say that midway between Thera and Therasia fires broke out from the sea and continued to burn for four days, so that the whole sea boiled and blazed, and that the fires cast up an island 12 stadia (2.2 km) in circumference, which was gradually elevated.

Thera. At the same time as an eclipse of the Moon, probably following a subdued eruption, an islet, which became known as Theia, rose up from the sea between Thera and Therasia in the Cyclades.\n<P>This event is well documented by contemporary authors, including Seneca, who confirms that it happened in his own time and during the consulship of Valerius Asiaticus (AD 46). Dio Cassius dates it Roman year 800 (AD 47), while St Jerome gives the fifth year of Olympiad CCVI (AD 45), and notes the length of the island as 30 stadia (5.5 km). Orosius (writing early in the fifth century AD) dates it to the fifth year of Claudius (AD 45-46).\n<P>Since Aurelis Victor mentions that it happened on the same night as a lunar eclipse, there is a chance of dating the eruption accurately. Schove and Fletcher (1987, 9-11) derive several dates, noting that the most popular is 31 December AD 46, because this would embrace both Seneca's date of AD 46 and Dio's of AD 47. However, he thinks that 6 July AD 46 is more probable because the eclipse would have been distinctly noticeable by about 8.53 pm, and consequently more likely to be recorded.\n<P>One must beware of confusing this eruption with that of Hiera in 199-198 BC, since the two occurrences were very similar in nature. Pliny mentions both, but the dates in the relevant passage are notoriously unreliable. Pliny's date, 8 July of the 110th year after the fourth year of Olympiad CXLV, works out as AD 3. This is due in part to a scribal error in an early copy of Pliny's works, when many events were assigned to Olympiad CXXXV.\n<P>Modern cataloguers associated this eruption with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66. Guidoboni (1989, 661-662), Guidoboni et al.

Crete. An earthquake felt in Crete was associated with an abnormal fluctuation of sea level. Apollonius, an eyewitness to the event, relates that, about midday, an earthquake shook the whole island and that at Leben, on the south coast of the island, south of Gortyna, the sea receded about 7 stadia (1.3km). He adds that travelers arriving from Cydoniatis (modern Chania) in the western part of the island reported that at the same time an island rose out of the sea between Thera and Crete.\n<P>The date of the event is not given, but Apollonius was in Sparta until the end of the winter of AD 61 and in the spring of the following year, AD 62, he proceeded to Crete. Although it is not known how long he stayed on the island, he arrived in Rome early in AD 64 or possibly, at the latest, in AD 66. There is no literary evidence that the shock caused any damage on the island; had it been serious, it would have been mentioned by Apollonius.\n<P>Archaeological evidence suggests some destruction at Gortya but this is dated vaguely to the period of Nero or Flavius (Di Vita 1986).\n<P>With few exceptions modern writers assign this event to AD 46 and associate it with the eruption of the volcano of Thera, for which there is no evidence.\n<P>(above from reference #9116)\n<P>62 A.D.

According to not very reliable data it was noted that the earthquake was accompanied by tsunami waves which were seen mostly on the south-western, southern and south-eastern coasts of the island: in Kition, Paphos, Salamis (Ref #2130).\n<P>76 A.D. Cyprus, Kition, Paphos and Salamis. Doubtful event based solely on a misinterpretation by Oberhummer of an allegorical statement in the Sibylline Oracles. Correct translation of Greek text indicates storm sea-waves, not\nuncommon in Cyprus. Contemporary and later writers do not mention seismic sea-wave in 76 A.D. (reference #15)\n<P>76 A.D. Cyprus, Kition, Paphos and Salamis. (reference #20)\n<P>76 A.D. Cyprus, Cition, Paphos and Salamis. A disastrous earthquake occurred in Cyprus in 76 or 77 AD. This earthquake is generally dated together with a pestilence in\nRome, in 77 AD, but early chroniclers differ in it slightly. We are inclined to think rather of 76 AD as the year for this earthquake because this was the year at which the Romans transferred their mint to Cyprus and the first coins minted there are dated July 76, August 77 and September 78. It is not improbable that this transfer of the mint was connected with the measures taken to relieve the island after the earthquake which is generally dated 767 AD but may have taken place a year earlier. Some few early chroniclers may have put the earthquake in 77 AD in order to synchronise it with the pestilence in Rome.\n<P>The facts about the particular places in Cyprus which were destroyed by this earthquake and the seismic sea-wave which is supposed to have accompanied this earthquake, are very obscure. \n<P>If we trust the allusion in the Sibyllina Oracula, the places in Cyprus which suffered most should have been Salamis, Paphos and Cition, but it is questionable whether these places suffered from the 76 AD earthquake or from a later shock. It seams probable, from the slight indications,\nmostly inferences from statements at a later date, that,\nwith the possible exception of Cition, Salamis and Paphos should lave been damaged to some extent by the 76 AD earthquake. The chroniclers were evidently not quite certain of the particular places in Cyprus which were damaged by this earthquake.\n<P>The Sibyllina Oracula prophesies also a destructive seismic seawave. This prophesy constitutes the sole authority upon which Oberhummer and after him many authors have based their arguments for the 76 AD seismic sea-wave in Cyprus. But we find no mention of such an event in the narrations of early chroniclers, and we feel that should an event such as a catastrophic seismic sea-wave had in fact accompanied this earthquake, it should have been most certainly included by these chroniclers in their description of the seismic events of 76 AD.\n<P>Whether, in this instance, the Sibyllina Oracula can be trusted as a source of authentic historical information, and if so, whether the seismic sea-wave in Cyprus which is mentioned in the text refers to the earthquake of 76 AD, all yet remains to be investigated. No other data worthy of any confidence has come to our attention. \n<P>(above from reference #23)\n<P>It is probably that the earthquake [76 AD] was associated with a seismic sea wave at Salamis and Paphos but it is not certain whether this was the result of this or of another earthquake.

In another letter to Tacitus, Pliny mentioned that \"...the sea was violent and hostile\".

This earthquake affected a large area in southwest Turkey and the Dodecanese Islands. Damage extended from the island of Cos and Rhodes to the Gulf of Antalya and to Cine in the north, an area of radius 90 km... Rhodes was ruined by the earthquake and the sea drew back, leaving the harbour dry... Aristides would seem to be writing about the second event [141 and 142]: he describes a seismic sea wave that destroyed Rhodes and left it ruined. This would tally with Pausania's second account, where he mentions that the cities of Rhodes were rebuilt by the emperor. (ref #9116)\n<P>142 (148). Island of Rhodes. The town of Rhodes was destroyed by an earthquake, and its ruins were washed away by the wave that rushed in so quickly that the citizens suffering the earthquake had no time to find their relatives; the sea water penetrated deep into dry land for several miles. The towns on the islands of Kos, Symi, Serifos suffered from the earthquake and tsunami (ref # 2130)\n<P>142. If we can trust Aristides's account, the city of Rhodes was practically devastated not so much by the earthquake as by the sea-wave which followed. Towns in the islands of Cos, Seriphos and Syme suffered heavily from both the earthquake shock and the ensued sea-wave. In Rhodes the sea advanced many miles inland and rased to the ground what ruins were left standing by the shock proper.

Strong earthquake affecting Caria and the Dodecanese islands, especially Rhodes, Kos, Simi and Serifos. Some authors place this event in 148 A.D. but most recent studies suggest the 142 A.D. as the most reliable date of occurrence. Many coeval sources report detailed description of the earthquake but only one refers that the shock was followed by a seismic sea wave. According to this source, the town of Rhodes was more devastated by the tsunami than by the shock. In Rhodes the sea advanced many miles inland. (ref #4139)\n<P>148. Dodecanese Is., 36 deg 18 min, 28 deg 36 min E, destructive sea inundation. (ref #2427)\n<P>Reliability = 3 (probable tsunami). In the rhetorical speech Rodiakos of Aristides Aelius (129189 AD), communicated to the citizens of Rhodes, a strong tsunami caused by the earthquake is described (see passages 2026): <i>. . . and I remember that in that fatal noon, when the calamity that happened to you started, when the sea was calm,. . . and all the earthquake force was directed against the city. . . Then the sea water retreated and the ports dried up. . . and the ports became as the dry ground. . . And everything happened at the same moment: the earthquake of the sea, the clouds, the roaring, the lamentations, the noise of the dead bodies, the ground subsidence. . . Everything had collapsed. . . . </i> In addition, the speech of Aelius makes clear that the islands of Symi (Dodecanese) and Serifos (Cyclades) were not destructed by the earthquake as claimed by Papazachos and Papazachou (1997) who apparently misunderstood passage 38 of the speech. The estimates for the year of occurrence of this earthquake and tsunami event range about seven years around 148.

The tsunami wave started with a large drop in water level; ships were left high & dry; many sea animals were beached; citizens rushed to the exposed shore to pick up fish with their hands. About 15 min later a large wave appeared with a roar, sweeping everything in its path. This turned out to be unexpected for the many thousand people crowding the coast and resulted in their death.

The date of occurrence is uncertain: some authors date the event in 542 B.C., others in 543 B.C. or in 544/545. According to Giudoboni, the description of anomalous sea behavior in Thrace is dated 544/545 B.C. In area of Odessos (today Varna), Dionisopolis (today Balchik) and Afrodision the sea went out of its coasts as far as 4000 steps (about 5.8 km) in the Thrace coast. Many people drowned.

In some places, the shore of Thrace was flooded for 3-4 km including Odessus, (i=4). The sea returned to its normal state after many people were killed and much damage done. Waves were observed in Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion, in the Gulf of Edremit, in Asia Minor where many towns were flooded. There exists no reliable information on the preceding earthquake, but values of its parameters are available: 40.3 N, 27.8 E, M = 6.8. (ref #2130) <P>542 Winter. Sea of Marmara. Thracian Coasts and Gulf of Edremit. From Cedrinos we learn that in the reign of Justinianus the sea flooded the coasts of Thrace and that the cities of Odessa (Varna), Dionysioupolis, Aphrodesion and other towns in the gulf of Adramyttium were inundated. The sea in many places advanced four miles inland and after drowning many people and causing heavy damage to the land retired to its habitual places... Neither Cedrinos nor Glycas imply in any way that the inundation of the Thracian coasts was the result of an earthquake. We notice, however, that Theophanes and Cedrinos mention in this period an earthquake which devastated Kyzicos (Banderma) and damaged Constantinople. This earthquake can be easily placed in the beginning of Sept 542 AD. This inundation of Thracian and Aegean coasts shows quite clearly the characteristics of a seismic sea-wave. It does not seem improbable that the cause of this wave was in fact the earthquake at Kyzicos (Banderma). When these two events happen to be so closely spaced together. From the narrations of the writers in the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae on earthquake events of the period, one feels inclined to go even further and suggest the earthquake at Constantinople of 542, that of Kyzikos and the seismic sea-wave that followed belong, if not to the same earthquake, but to the activation of the Marmara region. (ref #24) <P>544. Black Sea. A destructive sea wave in the Black Sea flooded the coast of Thrace, inundating Odessus (now Varna), Dionysopolis (now Balchik) and Aphrodisium by advancing 4 miles inland, drowning many people before retiring. This event is mentioned by Theophanes, who places it in a.M. 6037 (Sept 544 to Aug 545), or in the 18th year of Justinian (Cedr. CS 657), which commenced in April 544. He does not mention, however, whether this event was associated with an earthquake. (ref #9116) <P> Tsunami observed in the Kapidag Peninsula, Erdek, Bandirma. (ref #11164) <P> <blockquote><i>Ref #11868:</i></blockquote>  <P>A large earthquake occurring offshore of the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, very likely produced a strong tsunami that inundated in three coastal zones, namely Odessus, today Varna; Dionysopolis, today Balchik; Aphrodisium, situated in the Thracian Peninsula at the Xeros (today Saros) Bay, Northeast Aegean Sea. It is reported that sea advanced on Thrace by 4 mi and covered the three territories. Many drowned in the waters. However, no further details available. It is puzzling how a single tsunami event was capable to inundate coastal zones in Bulgarian Black Sea and the same time Thracian coasts facing the North Aegean Sea.

It is said that 30000 ( sic .) people were drowned by the sea wave, since, once the sea had retreated, they had gone down to the sea bed to plunder sunken wrecks, a grossly exaggerated figure given for Beirut alone (Ant. Plac. 159160). <P><i>Note: the deaths may not be certain, as noted by reference #12645</i>\n<P>Along the coast of Phoenice the sea receded for many hours by one to two miles ( sic .), stranding sailing boats in the shallows. Then the sea came back, throwing ships on land, causing great havoc before returning to its original level. A contemporary source (John Eph. NA. 489, 491) notes that the main earthquake was preceded by a shock that was responsible for setting off the seismic sea wave and that the main earthquake occurred after the sea had flooded the coast. Barring a degree of poetic licence, this statement implies two shocks within an hour." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 29.9, 40.8 ] } },

Eight cities were destroyed, the worst hit--Patrae, Naupactus, Chaeronea and Coronea, which were destroyed, with loss of life.\n<P>Procopius's contemporary and only account of these events in 551 says that at this time a (series) earthquakes occurred throughout Greece, affecting both Boeotia and Achaea and the country around the Crisean Gulf, as a result of which many towns and 8 cities, which are not named, were leveled to the ground, among which were Chaeronea, Coronea, Patrae and all of Naupactuc where there was also great loss of life... It goes on to say that, at Echinus and at Scarphea in Boeotia in the Gulf between Thessaly and Boetia, there was a sudden inlux of the sea, which leveled both towns. The sea flooded the mainland for a long time, so that for a very considerable period it was possible for men to walk to the islands, which are inside this gulf, since the sea had abandoned its proper place and spread over the land as far as the mountains. When the sea returned to its proper place, fish were left on the ground.\n<P>\nIt is important to recognize that Procopius places earthquakes in the plural, in the context of more than one earthquake in more than one place... he clearly refers to more than one, probably three, distinct earthquakes in central Greece, that is (1) a destructive shock in Boeotia that caused great loss of life in Schisma and destroyed Coronea and Chaeronea, probably damaging Corinth; (2) <b>a destructive sea wave at Echinus and Scarpheia</B>, which was probably associated with a second earthquake about 70 km away in the Maliakos Gulf between Thessaly and Boettia; and (3) a damaging shock more than 100 km to the west of Schisma in the Gulf of Corinth and in Achaea, which heavily damaged Nafpaktos and Patra.\n(above from reference #9116)\n<P>551 (possibly 552), spring or July 7.

The sky was illuminated like day-time. A little later, people, panic-stricken by the violent trembling, were lying on the ground; some were buried under fallen houses and others inside wide-opened ground fissures, while horses and cows desperately ran about and trampled each other. A number of castles, towers, and other tall structures collapsed. Then roarings like thunder were heard towards the sea. The sea soon rushed into the villages and towns, over-whelming a few hundred miles of land along the coast. There was scarcely any time for escape, though there were boats and the high ground just before them. In this way about 1000 people were killed.

Tsunami in Acre, and possibly nearby coast.\nThis earthquake and tsunami have been widely referred to in the published literature. Ambraseys (ref#15) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) relate this tsunami to the coasts of Lebanon and Israel. Amiran (ref#10419) suggest that the tsunami occurred on Jan 4, 1034, in Jaffa, and that the port of Akko fell dry for an hour. Soloviev (ref#2130) mention that tidal waves were observed in Gaza and Ashkelon, and that the seaport of Akko became dry for a long time and then it was half destroyed by a wave. Guidoboni (ref#10420) interpret that the tsunami effect is confined to Acre, but it is reasonable to suppose that the tsunami affected more of the coast. Ambraseys (ref#9116) constrains the tsunami to Acre and suggests that it did not cause damage or loss of life inland. Shalem (ref#10422), however, suspects this description might have been duplicated from the 1068 event. Following the detailed analysis of Ambraseys (ref#3845) and Guidoboni (ref#10420), the tsunami can be constrained to the northern and central coasts of Israel only.<P>Regarding the cause of the tsunami, Amiran (ref#10419) mention a swarm of earthquakes during the winter of 1033/4, probably in the Jordan Valley, including the strongest shock on 1033 12 10 and another one on 1034 01 04. Ambraseys (ref#10421) and Ambraseys (ref#3845) also locate the earthquake in the Jordan Valley but date it on 1033 12 05. A detailed analysis by Guidoboni (ref#10420) suggests that the earthquake occurred on 1033 12 05, although Arabic sources give the date of 1033 12 05 as 1034 01 04. In their opinion, Perrey (ref#10418) dated this event to 1032 03 06, which is then further confused with 1033 03 06, the date of the earthquake that occurred in Constantinople. <P>(above from ref #10416)<P>1033, Dec 5. A damaging earthquake occurred in Palestine... In Acre the sea flowed out several kilometres before flowing back as a wave an hour later. Although it drowned some of those who were foraging on the seabed, there is no evidence that it caused destruction or loss of life inland.( ref #9116)<P>1032. An earthquake in Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Askabh, Jerusalem and Gaza, was accompanied by an earthquake wave in the Mediterranean. (ref #1222)\n<P>1033-1034. In Syria, 1/3 of Ramala was destroyed. In Jerusalem the walls collapsed and the temple was severely destroyed. In Ghaza the mosque and its minarets at El Gaalan were destroyed also upper part of lighthouse badly damaged. In Nablus 1/2 of the city fell down, many villages in El Badou were swallowed up in the ground. In Egypt the earthquake caused much damage. There were 70,000 victims. (ref #1222)<P>1034, Jan. 4. Tsunami on the coasts of Lebanon and Israel, Acre. (ref #15 and #20)<P>1034, Jan 4; or Mar 6, 1032; 1039; or May 1035. A strong destructive earthquake occurred in the vast region from Syria in the northeast to Egypt in the southwest. Half of the city of Nablus and 1/3 of the city of Ramallah were destroyed. In Jerusalem, walls were destroyed, the temple was badly damaged, other buildings suffered damage. In Gaza the mosque and the lighthouse were damaged, heavy damage was caused in Ashkelon. After one or several earthquakes the sea retreated from the shore and returned swiftly. Tidal waves were observed in Gaza and in Ashkelon. The seaport of Akko became dry for a long time, then it was half destroyed by a wave. (ref #2130)<P>1035, April or May. From the study of the available information on these individual earthquakes, it appears that there are at least four major distinct earthquakes that occurred between 1033 and 1035 AD. A third very strong earthquake occurred in April or early May 1035 AD and damaged the northern provinces of Syria. It appears that the April or May 1035 AD earthquake was responsible for the seismic sea-wave. During this earthquake, extensive faulting and probably some crustal deformation occurred in the Saida-Sur area. (ref #26)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 35.0, 33.0 ] } },

Baffa (Paphos) and Limisso (Lemessos)\nwere then submerged by the sea ... and  ... the\nharbour (of Paphos) dried up, and then the town was\nsubmerged by the sea...\n<P>\nThere is no doubt that this event occurred on\nMay 1222 AD. In all earthquake catalogues this Cyprian earthquake is dated December 25, 1222. The reason for this is that many Latin chronographers considered the shaking of Cyprus as result of the great Lombardian earthquake of 25 December 1222 which shook also Tyrol, and southern Germany and which was followed by many aftershocks till January 11, 1223. This, once more, shows how misleading was the tendency of early chroniclers to treat collectively different earthquakes.\n(reference #26)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 33.0, 34.5 ] } },

The earliest information about the earthquake of 10 September 1509 in the Sea of Marmara comes from a letter written five days after the event, dated 15 Sept 1509, by Nicolo Zustignan a Venetian in Istanbul. There can be no doubt that the correct date of the earthquake is 10 Sept 1509, at about 10 at night in the New Style (N.S.), and that, from what has already been said the date 14 Sept assigned to the event by most writers is erroneous. As a result of the earthquake, in some places in Istanbul and Pera the ground opened up and fissured, presumably along the coast of the Golden Horn. Also as a result of the earthquake the sea retreated from the shore and then returned, flooding the coast over a very large area at places that are not named. When the sea came back to its previous place, the ground near the coast opened up and was left fissured. This phenomenon was observed on both sides of the Golden Horn on the coasts of Istanbul and Pera. Modern writers claim that as a result of the earthquake the sea overtopped the sea walls of the city. This information comes from later authors, who say that the sea in the Golden Horn was so strongly shaken that it was thrown over the walls of Istanbul and Galata killing 12000 people. There is no indication <i>in primary sources</i> that the flooding of the coast of the Golden Horn by the sea at the time of the earthquake caused any damage or that the Sea of Maramara flooded the south coast of the city.

Adriatic Sea, Gulf of Venice. Very strong underground shocks occurred in the regions of Friuli and Veneto at short time intervals between 20h and 20h30m; each of them lasted approximately 10sec and was accompanied by a loud underground rumble. Nothing but debris remained of the castle and an old extension of the church of S. Giovanni in Udine. The earthquake caused destruction in Cividale del Friuli, Madonna del Lanto, Faedis, Venzone, Tarcento, Tolmino and many other places. Rock falls occurred in the mountains near Gemona, and the River Livenza stopped flowing for a moment. Some old sources of water in the pleistoseistal area dried up, and new sources appeared. The earthquake was felt in Venice, Padua, Treviso, and in other places. The macroseismic epicentre was possibly located between Gemona (del Friuli) and Tolmino. 4-5 shocks more were felt at night, but they were weaker and shorter than the former.\n<P>Rollers appeared in the sea. They grew with such a roar that the citizens of Trieste, frightened by this phenomenon, were forced to leave their dwellings and to hide on the hill near the castle.

In addition to this, with reference to a source of the 16th century, data were given on the fact that during the earthquake in Venice the water went away far from the coast, and some fairly deep canals dried up. At the same time, the authors of the paper, on the basis of the absence of destruction and victims in Venice, believed that the estimate of the tsunami intensity should be reduced. \n<P>(above from reference #2130).\n<P>1511, March 26. 46<sup>o</sup>12'N, 13<sup>o</sup>26'E, earthquake magnitude 6.5, intensity IX, tsunami intensity 2, reliability 2.

A deluge of water engulfed Calais and Boulogne. The weather was calm at the time.\n<P>April 6, 1580, English Channel: Epicenter, probably submarine, near the east coast of Kent. Sandwich (51 deg 16 min N., 01 deg 21 min E) and Dover (51 deg 08 min N, 01 deg 18 min E) -- Sea much agitated, Vessels in the harbor were dashed together. (reference #43)\n<P>Effects on water were noticeable, especially since all accounts agree that at the time of the earthquake the weather was fine and calm. The agitation of the Thames is reported by Churchyard (1580) and others. In the English Channel, it was worse. At Sandwich, \"the sea so foamed, that the ships tottered\" (Stow, 1601). One contemporary account suggests that marine effects were more severe on the other side of the Channel. \"In Calais .. . there was such a horrible and fearful trembling that a great part of the houses collapsed and even the sea flooded into the town . .. In Boulogne there was a similar earthquake and flooding by the sea\" (Discours d'une ... , 1580). This may be a seismic sea-wave, but unfortunately there is some doubt about the time, and therefore about the actual relationship between earthquake and marine incursion. Elsewhere in the same document we find it stated that on the 7th April between 4 and 5 a.m. (which coincidentally is the time of the third Kent aftershock) \"there occurred in these places great signs of floods\". (reference #3945)\n<P>Varley (1996) states categorically that the earthquake produced a tsunami (which he refers to as a tidal wave) at Calais, Boulogne and Dover. Neilson et al (1984) are more cautious, considering that due to uncertainty about the coincidence in time of inundation and earthquake, the flooding report may have had some other cause (presumably meteorological). Melville et al (1996) are dismissive of the idea of a tsunami from this event. Evidence suggests (Melville et al 1996) that contemporary sources conflated descriptions of the earthquake with the effects of a storm that occurred very shortly afterwards. This is all the more likely since at this period it was not known that earthquakes were very short-lived phenomena, and to a 16th century writer it would have been natural to consider the seismic shock and a storm a day later as being part of the same occurrence. Undoubtedly the earthquake caused agitation of the water in harbours at Dover and Sandwich harbours (Neilson et al 1984). It is most likely that this movement was a seiche and not a tsunami as there is no evidence of any seabed displacement in the area and the strength of the earthquake (5.8 ML (Musson, 1994)) was insufficient to cause a tsunami directly.

There was an earthquake (17 S 72 W, mag 8.5) and tsunami in Peru and in the northern part of Chile. The tsunami flooded the coastline for a distance of 1200 km. Arica suffered most of all. According to a report of the governor of Arica, the ocean receded a distance of two musket shots further than its normal low water point, and then, while the tremors were still occurring, raged with such force that it covered the islet of Alacran, situated opposite the high part of the city. A barrack-type building (wooden or adobe) was carried away with this first wave. The second shock, which occurred 15 minutes after the first ebb, caused the water to recede again, only to reappear in rising form, sweeping the town and carrying away warehouses, stores, and a large church, and advancing another 100 m inland and destroying all houses. Subsequently, the water receded to the point where the anchors of all ships were exposed... Three persons drowned in Arica itself, and more than twenty along the coast... In Ilo, the water rose to a point where it advanced almost 2 km inland along a valley uprooting 100-year old fig trees. Eleven indians were drowned... Three high tides and ebbs were reported to have occurred in Camana. The water advanced along a valley for more than 2 km destroying everything in its path. Forty persons were washed away and drowned. \n<P>1705, November 26 (or 16). An earthquake occurred in Arequipa and Arica, and the wave generated during that quake flooded and destroyed a large part of Arica.

First Arica Earthquake. (Arica was probably affected by earlier earthquakes, such as the great Arequipa, Peru, earthquake of January 22, 1582; but no documents exist.) The exact date is given in an inventory of military supplies salvaged\nfrom the tsunami, dated December 5, 1604 and signed by the\nCorregidor of Arica. The port of Arica, formerly located near the center of the bay, was completely destroyed by the tsunami and the town was rebuilt at its present location, close to the famous Rock or Morro of Arica. Arequipa, in the Peruvian interior at a distance of about 260 km, was almost completely destroyed; only the convent of San Francisco remained standing. People were thrown to the ground by the earthquake; the losses were estimated at more than a million gold pesos. The tsunami is not accurately described, but it is known that at least three successive waves flooded the coast line along an extension of 300 \"leguas\", or 1200 km. The Peruvian port of Pisco more than 800 km northwest of Arica, was damaged by the tsunami according to one report. Damage from the tsunami extended across the Pacific Ocean. The effects of this great earthquake, as far as they are known, were similar to those of the great Arica earthquake of August 13, 1868. The\nmagnitude is estimated at 8 1/4-8 1/2.

There is no obvious relationship between the eruption magnitude and the magnitude of the ensuing tsunami[...] The hypothesis of a tsunami induced by an earthquake associated with the eruptive phases is not convincing too, since there is no sound evidence that the 1631 was immediately preceded by a shock the size needed to generate a tsunami. Subaerial or submarine landslides can be excluded. (reference #3347)\n<P>The cause- effect relationship between eruptive phenomena and the tsunami is not clear.

Nevertheless, the sea rushed inland so violently that 136 sailing ships were cast on shore. The original source of information seems to be a letter of Dr. Vivoli, to which unfortunately have not had access.

Mallet regards these two earthquakes to have occurred simultaneously on the 5th of April 1646. On the basis of the available information on these two events it is difficult to appreciate this coincidence.

While they were there, the sea level rose quickly and advanced \"in a frenzy\" without giving the observers a chance to escape, and thus they perished. The town was inundated and the sea advanced inland. Where the town once was, is now a bay in which ships lie at anchor. The town was rebuilt 1 km from the ocean shore. According to other reports, all houses in the town were washed away, but the more solidly constructed fortifications stood up. In Canete and Chincha, a similar inundation destroyed the warehouses in which 140 tons of mercury were stored and awaiting shipment to Acapulco. Chorrilos and Chancay were also inundated. <P>In Callao, the sea receded 2 km from shore, or, according to other data, far enough that the water was hardly visible. After some time the sea level rose, rushing in like a mountain of water, submerging the port and city of Callao and tossing vessels 4 km inland.

There are no reports about an earthquake. Was this a tsunami of remote origin. (Reference #414, first published in Russian, 1974). Reference #150 lists the source of the tsunami that attacked Otsuchi as off Miyagi Prefecture.<P>\n<P>A Pacific tsunami flooded Japanese shores in January 1700. The waters drove villagers to high ground, damaged salt kilns and fishing shacks, drowned paddies and crops, ascended a castle moat, entered a government store house, washed away more than dozen buildings and spread flames that consumed twenty more. Return flows contributed to a nautical accident that sank tons of rice and killed two sailors. Samurai magistrates issued rice to afflicted villagers and requested lumber for those left homeless. A village headman received no advance warning from an earthquake; he wondered what to call the waves. (from p. 27 reference #2479)\n<P>Places flooded by the 1700 tsunami in Japan include Kuwagasaki, Tsugaruishi, Otsuchi, Miho and Tanabe. Some of the accounts mention damage in additional villages. In one account, the tsunami takes the form of rough seas that initiate a nautical accident near Nakaminato. (from p. 33 reference #2479)\n<P>A trans-Pacific reunion took place in 1996. Orphaned for nearly 300 years, the 1700 tsunami in Japan was reuinted, on the pages of a scientific journal, with an earthquake and tsunami in North America... The orphan dated the earthquake to the evening of January 26, 1700... and gave its approximate size as magnitude 9. (from p.93 reference #2479)\n<P>Today the 1700 tsunami is securely linked to a giant North American earthquake. The tie was strengthened in 1997 by tree-ring dating that narrowed the time window for a great Cascadia earthquake to the months between August 1699 and May 1700. The earthquake's enormity was confirmed in 2003 through improved estimates of the tsunami's size and from computer simulations of Cascadia earthquakes and of the tsunami itself... The tsunami's written record in Japan has become clearer too, with discovery in 1998 of the Miho headman's account, authentification in 2002 of the Nakaminato shipwreck certificate and explanation in 2004 of a discordant date from Tsugaruishi. (from p. 93 reference #2479)\n<P>The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is situated off of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America, from Northern California to Vancouver Island, British Columbia. (from reference #2480)\n<P>If the 1700 tsunami came from Cascadia, we can estimate the origin time and magnitude of the earthquake. The earliest documented tsunami arrival time was around midnight on 27 January Japan time, or around 15:00 on 27 January GMT. Because tsunami travel time from Cascadia to Japan is about 10 hours, the earthquake origin time is estimated at around 5:00 27 January GMT or 21:00 on 26 January local time in Cascadia. This time is consistent with Native American legends that an earthquake occurred on a winter night. (reference #2654)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -125.0, 45.0 ] } },

The related earthquake occurred on February 2, 1703 at L' Aquila (Central Apennines) causing very strong damages and fatalities in all the region. The epicentral area was located inland about 100 km from the Tevere river mouth. Going back to coeval sources, the belief that the link between the earthquake and the tsunami is quite casual rises stronger. This conviction is supported by the fact that the information on the withdrawal is reported only by Baglivi [ref #10545]: \"...at the time of the second shock they say that the latin sea it the mouth of the Tevere river near the harbour, wandered away from the shore just for a little; at the end of the earthquake the water immediately came back\".

Later on the eruption seemed to spread into the lake, in the direction of Mount Macolod, which rises opposite the volcano on the southeastern shore of the lake. Great masses of smoke, water, and ashes rushed out of the lake, high up into the air, looking like towers.  Simultaneously there was a great commotion in the earth which stirred up the water in the lake, forming immense waves which lashed the shores as though a violent typhoon were raging. Their fury was such that in front of the Convento of Taal, and in other places of the beach, a strip of more than 10 brazas [16.7 meters] in width was engulfed by the water, and the church was endangered. On the following days, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, things continued in the same way, but by Sunday all the combustible material appears to have been consumed. This eruption killed all the fishes, large and small, the waves casting them ashore in a state as if they had been cooked, since the water had been heated to a degree that it appeared to have been taken from a boiling caldron. There was an all-pervading, pestilential stench of sulphur which greatly molested the inhabitants of the towns surrounding the lake. Sunday morning the sun broke through, but later torrential rains fell with thunder and lightning, some of the latter striking and the whole causing the greatest terror.

On 11 February at 2h in the night a very strong earthquake occurred and pulled down many houses in Leukada. The place set apart for women in the church of Evagelistria collapsed.\nMany parts of Saint Minas, the tower bell of Sotiros and the wall of Saint Paraskeve were fissured. Large damage occurred in the capital Amaxike. As it results from a memorial tablet in the wall of the Latin church Pantokrator, which was located in the fortress of Leukada and was built by Varbarigo Balbo in 1733, this church was pulled down by the earthquake. In the same note of Kontarini, it is written that at 2h in the night an earthquake occurred and it was near to destroy all houses in Lixuri. The sea rushed in the land and then withdrew. It caused damage in the northern and western part of Cephallonia, mainly in Palike, in Erisos, and in Argostoli. In Zante and Arta the earthquake was felt as very violent and as violent in Patra.

The tsunami of this year [1737], according to some data, can be considered the strongest of all those known on Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands. Detailed accounts of the phenomenon are listed below. <P>Through persons who have come from the Kuril, from the islands and from Cape Lopatka, also from Avacha, I have learned that there was a great earth tremor there, which began at all of the places mentioned at the same time. <P>On the first of the Kurile Islands, called Sumshchu [Shumehu], the earthquake was of the following form. On October 17 [October 6 Julian calendar] at 3 o'clock in the night the earth shook so sharply at first that many huts fell down. This quake came in waves from the SSE, and as soon as the shaking ceased suddenly came from the sea with great noise about 3 sazhens [6 m] of water, which immediately went out again far to sea. <P>With the recession of the water the earth shook again, only very slightly, and afterwards the water again came from the sea to the same place where it had been the first time. After a quarter of an hour the waters of the sea for the third time, with a very great noise, came up to about 10 sazhens higher than the previous places, which carried away many native dwellings. This water ran off again into the sea and throughout two days rose and fell. <P>Around Lopatka and at Avacha the quake began at the same date and hour, only it was slight the first time, but the second and third times it was as on the island, very sharp, so that many huts fell down. After the third time, the water came from the sea with a great noise, about 15 sazhens high, covering - all of the low places round about and also the lower hills. It carried away many native dwellings, baggage, food, and skin boats and caused no little loss to the Russians who were there at the time, who, leaving all of their baggage in the yurts, had to flee to high ground and there seek to save themselves. Between the rivers Viliuchik and the Avacha cove a small new cove was made. The place where the cove was formed was a meadow with kliukva and shiksha berries and two huts stood there in which the natives had put food.

By the age of the drift logs I could conclude quite confidently that in the inundation of 1738 [an obvious error; 1737 is meant] on the coasts of Kamchatka and the Kurile Islands, the waters also lashed Bering Island to a height greater than 30 sazhene [64 m]<P>(above from reference #413) <P>Reference #11787 states the following regarding Georg W.

A second eruption occurred on August 29. There was evidently no earthquake. A tsunami probably appeared at 20:00-22:00 on the 29th. A tsunami arrived on the coast on August 30 at 5:00 and did great damage in the region of Kumaishi and Masumae. The height of the waves was more than 9 m. On the 120 km stretch from Nebuta to Kumaishi, 1,467 people died, 729 homes were washed away and 33 homes were destroyed. Two warehouses were washed away and 25 were destroyed. There were 1,521 boats damaged. In Aomori Prefecture, 8 people died, 82 homes and 53 boats were washed away. Damage was done along the entire coast of the Sea of Japan; Sado Island suffered especially badly.

The shock that occurred on the 26th was almost as strong as that of the 25th.<P>The ocean began to recede about half an hour after the quake, and soon the half dressed, frozen and frightened inhabitants of Concepcion climbed the neighbouring hills from where they witnessed the approach of a strong sea wave descending upon the shore. The tsunami flooded the town (then situated in the site of Penco), and washed away the wreckage of buildings and domestic utensils. Seven minutes later the ocean returned with great force \"the waves crowded one on another,\" and the water level exceeded its usual limits; the water burst into the town with a speed exceeding that of a galloping horse, completely inundating the town. The water advanced quickly along the river, rising and inundating the adjacent areas and flooding even houses on higher ground. Boats and canoes were hurled into the church of San Francisco, located 400-500 m from shore. Subsequently, the water receded, again quite rapidly, carrying with it walls, some of which were still intact, and household items. Where the town had stood there was nothing but an impassable heap of ruins. And in the Cantarranos quarter, only the piles of the houses were left, all the rest having been washed away. Then the water receded again, just as on the previous occasion, but it rose and inundated the area two more times, the third flooding being the most severe. <P>The next morning it was established that the water level had varied considerably; in some areas the water had risen more than 3.5 m (4 varas), in others less. <B>Twenty-five to thirty old persons and invalids (17 persons, according to other accounts) were drowned</B> in the waves of the tsunami - the only victims of the earthquake. <P>The vessel \"St. Anthony and Family,\" loaded with goods and passengers, lay at anchor in the port of Concepcion. The seaquake was very severe and it was feared the vessel might be destroyed, but it survived. With the first strong ebb, the anchor chain broke, and the ship itself was grounded, listing heavily. The returning tide hit the vessel, causing it to list the other way. Then the vessel found itself floating. Subsequently, the sea rose 17 m (9 1/2 fathoms) and the ship was thus refloated. There were three strong tides and ebbs, and each time the vessel became grounded. <P>After this destructive flood - the fourth and most severe in the history of the city - Concepcion was rebuilt farther  from the shore, and its old location was eventually used to build the new town of Penco. The tsunami was also recorded in Valparaiso. <P>The waves hit the island of Juan Fernandez, washed away a settlement and sank a vessel anchored in the port. <B>The governor of the island, his family along with 35 other persons perished</B>. <P>The tsunami reached threatening proportions in Callao; but no one died<P>There are some reports to the effect that the bottom of Concepcion Bay had risen 7 m (24 feet) during the earthquake; the resulting shoal consisted of hard sandstone rather than sand.<P>Naturalists who later visited the area of Concepcion, found, in areas of considerable elevation, many mollusc shells which were packed with river sand; such shells normally occur in the littoral zone.<P>The tsunami reached the southeastern coast of the island of Honshu, flooding the houses on Otsuki on the Djika peninsula and in Kesennuma to above the floors, but there were no deaths.\n<P>(above from reference #415)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -73.0, -37.0 ] } },

The tsunami was noted throughout the Azores. Angra de Heroismo (38 39 N., 27 13 W.), Ilha Terceira inundated. The water rose up to Praca Velha, a place situated 300 m from the sea at an elevation of 15 m. The reflux stranded vessels anchored in the roadstead. 3 waves destroyed 15 houses at Praia da Vitoria. The water rose 2 m at Porto Judeu (38 39 N., 27 07 W.). At Horta (36 32 N., 28 37 W.) Ilha de Fayal (38 34 N., 28 41 W.) the sea rose, then dropped, 3 times with increasing violence. The maximum wave height was 13 m.<blockquote><i>Ref #2539:</i></blockquote> The destruction was greatest in Algarve, southern Portugal, where the tsunami dismantled some coastal fortresses and, in the lower levels, razed house. In some places the waves crested at more than 30 m. Most coastal towns and villages of Algarve were heavily damaged, except Faro, which was protected by sandy banks. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. For the coastal regions the destructive effects of the tsunami were more disastrous than those of the earthquake.<blockquote><i>Ref #1201:</i></blockquote> The great earthquake was accompanied by a tidal wave which destroyed Lisbon & devastated Marco, there were thousands of victims and enormous damage at Marrakech, Meknes, Ceuta, Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca, Safi and Agadir.<blockquote><i>Ref #43:</i></blockquote> Seiches occurred. Many lakes in the British Isles, in the Alps, in Germany, and in southern Scandinavia were disturbed, as were some fiords in Norway and lochs in Scotland.<blockquote><i>Ref #9504:</i></blockquote> All in all, the 1755 earthquake and the resulting tsunami and fires caused between 40,000 and 50,000 deaths in Portugal, Spain and Morocco. <P><blockquote><i>Ref #3730:</i></blockquote> The earthquake which struck on 11/1/1755 caused up to 100,000 deaths through destruction by ground shaking, from the ensuing fires and by tsunami waves of 515 m which devastated the coasts of Southwest Iberia and Northwest Morocco. <blockquote><i>Ref #2702:</i></blockquote> In Portugal the estimated number of casualties due to the earthquake, the tsunami and the fire points to 10,000 people, although several coeval documents refer to a larger number of victims; the number of casualties due exclusively to the tsunami is about 1000. Downtown Lisbon was completely flooded by the rise of the river Tagus; the penetration distance of the water from the river was 250 m. The 'wall' built by king Philip I of Portugal, I1 of Spain, to guard the city worked as an obstacle to the waters of the river Tagus. <blockquote><i>Ref #2853:</i></blockquote> This discovery raises the possibility that the tsunami was partly generated by an earthquake-triggered fault on the seabed and partly by submarine sediment sliding. <blockquote><i>Ref #4139:</i></blockquote> 37 N 10 W, magnithde 8.5, intensity 11.5<P><blockquote><i>Ref #9243:</i></blockquote> <P>The tsunami was <b>not</b> observed at Le Robert or Sainte-Marie, both on Martinique.  <P>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Portugal\">tsunami-travel-time map</a> created from TTT software (Wessel, 2005)." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -10.0, 37.0 ] } },

On the Kume and Kerama Islands, 350 km northeast of the source of the earthquake, the tsunami was weak. On Yonaguni Island, about 180 km southwest of the source, and also on Hateruma and Iriomote Islands, the shores of which are protected\nby coral reefs, there was no great destruction.  \n<P>The islands of Ishigaki, Taketomi, Kuroshima, Aragusuku, Miyako, Irabu, Tarama, and Mizuna situated closest to the source (60-80 km), suffered greatly and there were many victims there.\n<P>The damage done by the waves on Ishigaki and Miyako Islands was about the same. However, the quantitative data on the height of the waves on these islands are contradictory. In the Japanese literature, the shaku (30.3 cm) and the jo (3.03 m) are usually used as a unit of measure of length. In all probability, the shaku and the jo were confused in a number of cases describing the tsunami.

On Tarama and Mizuna Islands, closest to the source, absolutely everything was washed away and the villages were leveled.\n<P>The tsunami approached Ishigaki Island and adjacent islands from the southeast, and the villages Maezato, Ohame, Miyara, Shiraho, Tozato, Ibaruma and Yasura, on the eastern coast, were completely washed away. More than half of the homes were washed away at the villages of Ishigaki, Shinkawa, Toyashiro, and Hirae, on the south side of the\nislands.\n<P>There was similar destruction on Kuroshlma and Aragusuku\nIslands; in all, 2,123 homes were washed away and 9,393 people died.\n<P>In all the Ryukyu Islands, this tsunami washed away and destroyed 3,137 homes and <B>killed 11,941 people</B>.

Excerpt from journal of the ship's commander: On Jan 8, 1780, on the 18th island, called Urup, there were great quakings of the earth, every day, both by day and by night. ... On June 18 [June 18 Julian date is equal to June 29 in Gregorian calendar], in the night before morning, almost at dawn, there was a great and terrible quaking of the earth, which continued for a quarter of an hour  they looked at the sea: in the distance fires flashed like lightning.  And a little while after the quake there was suddenly a loud rumbling. That was the running out to sea of a strange, swift tide. Stones which had been in the sea by the shore were left dry. And with the same noise first the water ran in from the sea in a great wave, and the whole shore, except for the bluff, was covered, and then the water, swiftly and with the same noise, returned to the sea. And the sea fell even more than before... And the water came swiftly from the sea like a wall, rising higher than all of the small shore crags by 5 or 6 sazhens, and it suddenly poured into the cove with as strong and sharp an onslaught as on the bluffs of the river. Our yurts and huts and everything that was there, to the last post, were torn from the ground and carried away up the creek into the gulch. And all of the people and their gear were carried along the gulch. Even stones which had been at the mouth of the creek were rolled out and carried away. There was an iron cannon on the bluff -- it was found about 50 sazhens away. And the gulches near the sea were filled with water to the top. The ship, the brigantine Sviataia Natalica, was carried with its anchor straight along the creek over the tundra into the gulch and was set down on dry ground near a rivulet. From the sea to the ship was 190 sazhens. And the breadth of the low ground across the gulch at the place where the ship was would be about 100 sazhen. Of the working people, they found <B>4 dead after the water went down</B>. And all that day until evening the water went back and forth, rising and falling, only less from hour to hour. And afterwards the people gathered all of the baggage that had been carried away and dried it. And after several days they went in skin boats to visit their people who had been elsewhere. They learned that the eastern and southern sides of the island had been inundated by the flood. At one place <B>eight of the natives were drowned</B>, they said. On the north side of the island there was no flood and the water did not rise at all. It is not known whether there was a rising of the water beyond where we were, on the 19th (Iturup) and 20th (Kumashir) islands. On June 28 Shabalin lent people to Kamchatka in one skin boat with the report, and I had to follow them on July 1 through the islands from the 18th. From the time of the flood up until our departure there were frequent quakes every day. On the 17th (Chirpoi), 16th (Simushir), and 15th (Ketoi) islands, also, there were frequent tremors while we were there. The sea flood which had risen on the 18th island had also come up on these islands but less. On the 14th (Ushishir) and other islands closer to Kamchatka there were no longer frequent quakes and there had been no rising of the waters.<P>Erroneously reported on the following date(s)in other publications: June 18, January 19.<P><blockquote>Reference #150</blockquote>1780, June 29. 45.3 N, 151.2 E, tsunami validity 4, magnitude 3.

The reported number of fatalities associated with this event that occurred between April and June 1781 is inconsistent between all entries. Three out of four entries that record this event provide details of a tsunami. The death of one woman was reported in 2 entries with reference made to Taiwan interview catalogue (Chen et al., 1830). In contrast, Yang (1987) recorded >50 000 deaths associated with a tsunami caused by a Taiwan Strait earthquake in May. In citing >50 000 deaths Yang also quoted descriptions from Chen et al. (1830). The death toll reported for this event appears erroneous since it is not cited in the detailed publications of Soloviev and Go (1974), and Zhou and Adam (1986). However, the inclusion of the 1781 tsunami-like event into the work of Yang (1987) has been generally accepted and this deadly tsunami report is now widely quoted among Chinese literatures (e.g. Wang and Bao, 1992; Ye et al., 2005). <P>The Yang (1987) record of the 1781 April-June event (#14) is possibly the best example of how erroneous reporting can arise when including information from previous publications. In this entry, Yang outlines many detail including a tsunami that lasted for 18 h from which over 50 000 people died at Taiwan and Taiwan Strait. The descriptions are similar to those for the 22 May 1782 event (#15) recorded for Taiwan by Iida et al. (1967) and Soloviev and Go (1974). Therefore, it appears very likely that Yang (1987) mixed details of the 1782 event with that of 1781 when composing the tsunami event list.<P><blockquote><i>Reference #10200:</i></blockquote>   <P>This sea-surge occurred somewhere between 24 April 1781 and 21 June 1781, at Qieteng Bay, Taiwan (near the current Dapeng Bay, Donggang, approximately 30 km southeast to Kaohsiung) [Q8]. The flood was reported to last for a few quarters, which is a typical period of a tsunami. Based on conditions 1 and 2 (see Sect. 4.1.1 and 4.1.2), this event is sufficient to be validated as tsunami. The weather was reported to be fine, eliminating the possibility of a storm surge. No earthquake was reported in the region in this period, suggesting that the tsunami was probably not tectonic in origin. The run-up was reported both quantitatively (tens of zhangs) and qualitatively (about a bamboo high). One woman was reported to be drowned. The reporters name was also recorded, which was not a common practice in local historiographies, giving support to the reliability of the report.

Very likely the earthquake is not directly responsible for the tsunami (at the epicentre, waves observed about half an hour later than the ground shaking). Tsunami probably due to a huge earthquake-induced rockfall: a portion of the Monte Campalla (south-western side of the Scilla beach) collapsed into the sea. The front of the failing mass was about 450 m long and penetrated the sea at most by 100 m (Minasi, ref #4125).

The water climbed the Livorno stream op to 200 m from the sea shore, then reached Chianalea and Marina dell'Oliveto, located on the other side of the promontory. Three big inundations were observed. At Marina Grande the Santo Spirito church was destroyed, the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, located at a distance of 90m from the shore was inundated as well as San Nicola church. A woman entangled in a mulberry tree at an height of 8.3 m near the Gornelle fountain. According to Sarconi (ref #4124) in Marina Grande (Scilla) inundation heights in the range of 6-9 m observed, while according to Minasi (ref #4125) wave height of 16 m. At Nicotera the sea withdrew then inundated the shore carrying some fishing boats. Also Bagnara affected by the inundation. Cannitello was affected by the waves. At Messina the sea was seen to rise and noisily overflow its coast. According to Minasi (ref #4125) sea level rose of about 2 m. Tsunami also quite relevant at the headlight.

At each recoil of this tremendous surf the whole space between the channel further than Blockade was laid nearly bare, so as to discover frightful rocks and fragments, that before had never been visible. The water dashed against the barrack pale, & at the next returned reached to their very top, in one dreadful mass threatening destruction to the whole town; and our fears suggested, that had it then broke upon us its fury must have been irresistible: this happily was not the case, though many houses were much damaged, and one swept totally away. This rage of the element continued the whole night; nor did the tide recover its usual flow until the third day following. Between us and the Little Island many rocks appeared at intervals which had ever before been secreted from the eye by a depth of water. In Pigrun Bay, from the exposed situation of which such a rapid surf would be less unaccountable, no difference was visible, nor was any part of the Island, to the eastward of Far Bay, at all affected, tho' an easterly wind prevailed almost the whole time.\" (ref #11623)\n<P> A private letter received by the Ferret from Norfolk Island, of May 23 says, \"the weather has for many weeks past been frightfully tempestuous, insomuch that no boat could at any time with safety put off from the shore; and on the 11th of the present month it were the most serious and distressing appearance, exhibiting a phenomon at the same time never before witnessed. At half past four in the afternoon, then low water, the surf began to beat with unusual violence and rapidity, at frequent intervals occasioning an influx into the town of <B>16 feet perpendicular height</B>; the consequences of which were severely felt by the houses in the lower row, the backs of which were beat down and washed away with the surf, which with equal velocity returned to the low water mark. It continued thus, with little abatement, until one in the morning of the 12th, when happily the consternation was removed with its cause; but during the continuance of which every building within the possible reach of the exasperated element was emptied of its contents. A number of inhabitants have suffered by the deluge, which, had it unfortunately happened at high tide, it is supposed must have swept away the whole town of Sydney (ref #11624)\n<P>In the month of May, 1805, Norfolk Island experienced a considerable influx of the sea, which, from the extraordinary nature of the occurrence, is worthy of mention. The tide first ebbed to a great distance; when, suddenly, an unusual swell was seen coming in, which occasioned considerable alarm to the colony, to whom such a circumstance was entirely novel: it rose to a great height, and retired to its channel. A second time it revisited the shore, and flowed to a more considerable height than before: a second time it retreated; and once again returned, with a fury surpassing its former efforts; paralyzing the spectators with terror, who were unable to imagine where the extraordinary swellings might pause. For the last time, however, the ocean left the shores, without having caused any material damage; and, in its regress, it opened the secrets of the deep, and displayed to \"mortal ken\" rocks which had remained until now undiscovered.

What is said here confirms the end of the preceding paragraph: de Cato, and some others have informed me that the sea, several times in the course of time, has risen four or five feet above its normal level, and has come rolling. in a heavy wave through the grass and bushes. It remained for a short time, and then suddenly retreated, leaving a good quantity of fish through the grass and bushes ... These sudden overflows of the sea occurred twenty or thirty years ago. This, I think, is very singular because I had never heard that the sea could rise so suddenly in any part of the world.

It was the strongest explosion in historical times in Indonesia. It was accompanied by considerable oscillations in sea level. The eruption began on April 1. At 22:00 [local time] at Bajuwangi (Java Island), a cannonade boomed out like peals of distant thunder. It was repeated from time to time, and this continued until 9:00 on the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, a light fall of ashes began; on the 5th, explosions began to be heard at 1/4 hour intervals.\n<P>The eruption reached its peak on the evening of the 10th, when a colossal pillar of smoke rose above the volcano and the entire mountain seemed to eject flame. Soon the volcano and all that occurred there were hidden in a dense cloud of smoke. \n<P>The sound of a shot was so loud that it was heard for an enormous distance: from Bengkulu and Banka Island in the west to Ternate Island in the east. At Surabaja, the air wave uprooted trees, destroyed the walls of homes, and bowled over people and animals. The tremors were felt more or less strongly at Banjuwangi, Sumenep, Surakarta, Rembang, apparently on the southeast of Kalimantan Island, at Makassar and on Flores Island.\n<P><B>Scorching hot slag and ashes covered all of Sumbawa Island and a sizeable water area. Buildings collapsed under this load. The previously picturesque island was turned into a desolate desert. Of 12,000 residents, only 26 survived.</B> On neighboring Lombok Island, the depth of the layer of ashes was 0.5 m. A similar layer of ashes was floating at sea west of Sumbawa Island on the 12th. On Java Island, the ashfall was so dense that complete darkness set in. The ashes fell on Java at a distance of 550 km from the volcano; it also fell on Sulawesi Island at Ambon. From this one can conclude that the ash was ejected to a very great height, as otherwise it would have been carried by the trade winds only to the west.\n<P>On the 10th, with still weather, the sea off the coast of Sumbawa Island suddenly rose to a height of 0.5 to 3.5 m. Large waves burst into the estuaries of the rivers and immediately surged back. Here and there homes and trees were washed away. At Bima, the water submerged the floors of homes by 0.3 m. All the proas and boats were torn from their anchors and tossed onshore. The coast at the Tambora volcano subsided so that water 5-6 m deep appeared in place of the land.\n<P>Short-period (duration no more than 3 minutes) oscillations in level were noted on Sulawesi and Java Islands. At Sumenep, on the 11th at 19:00 during an ebb tide, a flood tide of water from the bay made the river rise 1-1.5 m; then the level fell for 4 minutes.\n<P>The explosions of the volcano, which were accompanied by strong tremors, lasted several more days.

Early on a summer morning in the early 1800s, a large landslide occurred at Camano Head, carrying standing trees to the beach, and burying many people living at the toe of the bluff. The landslide sounded like thunder and created large volumes of dust. The landslide also resulted in a tsunami that traveled south toward Hat Island, washing over the barrier beach, destroying houses or encampments and drowning many people.\n<P>The accounts make no mention of ground shaking, suggesting that the landslide was not associated with a major earthquake.\n<P>The Camano Head landslide is the only known example of a landslide on Puget Sound generating a tsunami large enough to cause significant loss of life.\n<P><P><blockquote><i>Reference #11942:</i></blockquote> \n<P>One of the Snohomish villages was located beneath a bluff at the southern tip of Camano Island, Camano Head.

In the year 1821, I was a midshipman in his majesty's ship Vigo, guard-ship at St. Helena, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Lambert, and commanded by Cap. Thomas Brown, during the latter period of Napoleon's exile. I had charge of an excellent establishment on shore, called the stockyard, for keeping a supply of fat cattle for the squadron after its arrival from the Cape, lank and lean. My party of men always slept on board, landing the next morning at daylight. It was in the early part of May, a month rendered remarkable by the death of the great chieftain, which took place on the 5th day, that we were pulling in as usual the launch, with several working parties on board, but observing that the surf was too violent for the large boat filled with men, to attempt a landing, we tried to accomplish it by a few at a time, in the jolly boat. A small number, including myself, got on shore in this manner. Shortly after I was engaged in conversation with an officer of the Hon. Company's ship Ganges, surrounded by native women, some children, and Lascars, when I felt myself forcibly pulled by the arm, and heard a person exclaim--\"Look at the horizon, run, save yourself, we shall all be lost!\" I did look, and the sight I shall never cease to remember, it was so frightfully grand. On the horizon, from the north-west, appeared an immense undulation, or swell, resembling a bank of water rolling majestically in, directly in the wind's eye. Whether it was my anxiety for the boats, or that astonishment had paralyzed me, I cannot tell, but I felt riveted to the spot alone, and before I could attempt to save myself, as others did, by climbing the rocks I was whirled along with the rapidity of lightning, in the midst of this dark wave.\n<P>\"Almost in an instant I experienced a violent shock, which stunned me for a few moments; on recovering the perfect use of my senses, I found myself in the armourer's cave, with the forge lying across my thigh. To this circumstance I must draw attention, as, by its weight keeping me from going into the sea as the water receded, and from being dashed against the rocks, to it I owe my preservation. Near me were lying two Lascars, one was split up the middle, the other's skull was beat to pieces--<B>both were dead</B>. Fearing a return of the surf, as the sea usually runs in quickly twice, and then comes with redoubled violence, I made the best use of my lungs; the carpenter fortunately heard my cries, and rescued me. My clothes were torn to shreds, my ears, eyes, and nose, filled with ashes and blood; but with the exception of a few contusions, and lacerated hands, I was otherwise unhurt. <B>One woman was drowned</B>, and several men and children were picked up by the boats.\n<P>\"This first swell that I have mentioned was the prelude to a gigantic surf, which lasted three days. This phenomenon (as nothing like it had ever taken place in the memory of the oldest inhabitants) was attributed to an <B>earthquake</B>. We had only telegraphic communication with the ship while it lasted. The fortifications were much injured in front of St. James Town; huge rocks were torn up and tossed into our little bathing place to the left of the landing; the guard-house was abandoned the sea reaching the upper windows; the ships rode with sails aback, to keep them astern of their anchors; and, while it lasted, to see the mass of water burst upon the cliffs, as if to shake the island from its foundation, was the grandest sight I ever beheld.\"<P>(above from reference #4222)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -5.7, -15.95 ] } },

There was a destructive earthquake in Valparaiso and surrounding districts. At the time of the most severe shocks, the ocean receded in the epicentral zone, only to rise and advance upon the shore again and again. In Valparaiso, at the time of a full ebb, the sea suddenly rose and just as suddenly receded. A launch from the admiral's ship, which was on its way to render assistance to people on shore, was thrown up to the gates of the customs house, located 3.5 m higher than the ordinary high tide mark. Suddenly, the sea began to recede very rapidly, stranding small vessels and boats. All this occurred within 15 minutes. Several minutes later, a second wave of reduced intensity appeared. In all, three large floods and ebbs of a height of 3.6 m (12 feet) were recorded. On the morning of the 20th, the sea level fluctuations were normal again. (reference #415)\n<P>1822 Nov. 19. Chile. Epicenter about 15 miles north of Valparaiso. Waves were reported along the coast from Rio Copiapo to Valdivia. The sea near Valparaiso rose to great heights, then receded so far that small boats were left dry upon the strand. It continued rising and falling to a gradually diminished extent for a quarter of an hour. The earthquake was also felt on board ships lying off Callao. Melipilla, Quillota, and Casablanca were destroyed by the earthquake. (reference #39)\n<P>1822, Nov. 19. During the first shock on the night of Nov. 19, the sea in Valparaiso harbour rose to a great height, so as to carry boats farther in than any boat had been before. It then receded so as to leave the small vessels, that were afloat before, dry on the beach. A few minutes later, there was a second wave, though not reaching the level of the first, possibly on account of the rise of about 3 ft. in the bed of the harbour. The seawaves were of short duration and, after a quarter of an hour, ceased to be noticeable. (reference #516)\n<P>1822, Nov 19, 10:15 pm local time.

Burns (1859) records the following: \"One morning I was strolling along the beautiful beach in Poverty Bay, admiring the rising sun ... I had not proceeded far before I felt a powerful shock of the earthquake which nearly took me off my feet, rocking the trees to and fro and causing an immense swell in the sea. I knew perfectly well, from experience, that it was not an earthquake, but an electric shock caused by the eruption of a volcano or burning mountain, about 40 miles in the interior of the country; an occurrence not infrequent in those parts ...\". \nDespite Burns associating the shock with an eruption, his account clearly describes an earthquake, with an intensity of at least MM6-MM7. His association of the earthquake with the immense swell of the sea suggests the two events occurred within short space of time, indicating a local source or seiching caused by surface waves from a more distant large (M>7.5) earthquake. However, seiching is unlikely to occur on the open coast, except within in a confined harbour or estuary, unlikely to be more than a metre and unlikely to initiate the comment immense swell. This suggests a local earthquake source within a short tsunami travel time (< 30 minutes), perhaps 50 km from Gisborne. \nGiven that \"tsunami earthquakes\" like the 1947 March and May events (q.v.), which caused only mild shaking, have occurred on this part of the coast, determining an appropriate magnitude for an earthquake large enough to cause a tsunami and close enough for it to arrive within a short time, but only large enough to cause moderate intensities is problematic. However, a large strong shaking plate interface earthquake (magnitude greater than 8 with maximum shaking intensities of MM8 and larger) is not indicated. \nAccording to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography Vol 1, Burns first came to NZ about 1830. A short time after February 1831 he returned to NZ as a trader at or near Mahia. Early in 1832 he moved to inland Poverty Bay, remained a few months only, and then moved to Tolaga Bay where he remained until October 1834, when he permanently left NZ. This indicates the earthquake occurred between 1831 and 1834, not 1832-38 as suggested by Grouden (1966) and later publications based on this data. The date range is not restricted to the time Burns was in Poverty Bay (a few months in 1832) as he may have travelled on occasions to Poverty Bay from Mahia or Tolaga Bay. \nA validity of 3 is assigned [tsunami].

There was a destructive earthquake (37N 73W, mag 8.25) and tsunami in the center part of Chile with its source near Concepcion. <P>When the earthquake began, the whole surface of water in Concepcion (Talcahuano) Bay churned. The water darkened and gave off the very unpleasant odor of hydrogen sulphide. At approximately one half hour after the earthquake, the water in the bay receded to the point where all rocks and reefs were laid bare. Then it flooded once more and again receded so that vessels anchored in the bay appeared to be on dry land. Then a huge wave, from the island of Quiriquina, passed along the west shore of the bay, shearing off houses, uprooting trees, sweeping and carrying away everything that was movable... After several minutes a second huge wave appeared, approaching with an even more terrifying noise and violence than the first. Despite the enormity of the wave, its passage was less destructive since there was little left to destroy... After several minutes of tense expectancy, the inhabitants, who had taken refuge on higher ground, saw a third wave rolling between the island of Quiriquina and the mainland.. This wave appeared even larger than the two previous ones (by other accounts, it was somewhat smaller); it roared, dashing against obstacles and carrying along everything in its path. Then suddenly, as if repulsed by the foothills, the water receded, carrying away such a huge quantity of articles snatched from houses (partitions, furniture, etc.), that after the ebb, the whole ocean appeared to be covered with this wreckage. This disaster prompted the inhabitants to begin noticing approaching waves when they were still 5-7 km away from shore. <P>\nWaves were reported along the coast from Valparaiso to the island of Chiloe, a distance of more than 1000 km.\n<P>In Talcahuano Bay, one woman took to a boat with her son, but...the boat split and the <B>woman drowned</B>.  Near Niebla Port, Valdivia, a <B>man and a woman drowned</B>, apparently while collecting shellfish. <P>A segment of the Chilean coast in the earthquake focal zone was elevated. The bay at Talcahuano became shallower while the shore of the bay was lifted approximately 1 m. The coast at San Vicente rose 0.5 m. Santa Maria Island rose 2.5-3 m in the middle, 3 m in the north, 2.5 m in the south. Mocha Island rose 0.5 m. Then the elevated block slowly subsided and after 2 months the rise of the shores at Talchuano was reduced to 0.5 m. This subsidence apparently came to a stop simultaneously with the cessation of the aftershocks.\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #3903:</i></blockquote> \n<P>\"[Charles] Darwin described the tidal wave at Valdivia in 1835, again following a severe earthquake, as producing a quiet rapid rise and rapid fall...[At Concepcion] Thirty minutes after the earthquake the sea retired so far as to strand ships in 7 fathoms of water.

The small amount of damage was attributed to the prevalence of timber construction. Montessus de Ballore claims that no \"maremoto\" was generated; yet the reports of tsunami damage on Samoa, Hawaii, and the coast of Japan must be connected with this event. Three successive fluctuations of the sea were observed in Ancud, but no wave was generated along the east coast of the island.

The vessel was eventually repaired and got off, but the anchors and mooring chains were buried under seven feet of sand and the crew had to dig them out.\" Assuming that the sailors of the time were completely familiar with tide times, local tidal eccentricities and vagaries of the weather, it is difficult to find an explanation for the quite damaging effects given here. A tsunami is a credible explanation, not only of the sudden change in tidal current but also the burying of the anchors and mooring chains in sand and the beaching of the vessel. \n<P>According to the Department of Conservation website: The first Europeans in the area were sealers and whalers.

At Perrey's request, Osten-Saken reviewed the records of the Russian-American Company for the years 1840-1860 and sent him all of the information that he found there concerning seismic and volcanic phenomena in the territories of the company.\n<P>P.N. Doroshin compiled a list of earthquakes in the same territories for the years 1840-1866 on the basis of similar material and also of his own notes which he made during his service with the Company.\n<P>Below we present the text of Doroshin with small additions from the text of Osten-Saken.\n<P>\"On April 13, 1843, at Urup at sunrise there were two strong shocks three seconds apart. They were preceded by a roar like distant thunder. The shocks came from the southwest and continued for seven seconds. After about three [?] minutes, with a fresh west wind, the water began to flow with terrible swiftness out of the bay [Aleutka] where the settlement was located, and the bottom of the bay was left completely dry. Then with the same speed the bay again filled with water and even inundated the shore to a considerable height. For several days the water was in constant movement; now it would come in, now go down, and each change was accompanied by a strong rip (agitation from the meeting of the currents).\"\n<P>This earthquake, apparently was one of the catastrophic ones, as it was observed on all of the southern Kurile Island and on the east coast of Hokkaido. In the Nemuro and Kushiro areas the earthquake attained destructive force. Thus, it is reported that in the town of Akkeshi, situated between these two points, one of the tombs was moved 1.5 m.; in the temple grounds fissures 10-15 cm. wide were formed. The earthquake was followed by destructive tsunamis; in the Kushiro area the height of the waves was 4.5 m. Especially affected by the tsunamis were the villages located on the shores of Akkeshi Bay which has the shape of a bent funnel, penetrating deeply into the land. In the village of Shinryu, at the bend of the funnel, all of the houses were washed away by the waves and <B>45 persons perished</B>.\n<P>According to Japanese estimates, the intensity (magnitude) of the earthquake was M = 8.25 to 8.5. Taking into the account the considerable extent of the center of the quake and the area of occurrence of the tsunami, this estimates seems likely to be correct.\n<P>(above from reference #413)\n<P>April 25, 1845, 42 N, 146 E, magnitude 8.4, tsunami intensity 2, validity 4. <B>46 deaths</B>, 75 houses destroyed.

The day he reached Luckput there were shocks of an earthquake, which shook down part of the walls of the fort, and some lives were lost. At the same time as the shock the sea rolled up the Koree (the eastern) mouth of the Indus, overflowing the country as far westward as the Goongra river (a distance of twenty English miles), northward as far as a little north of Veyre (forty miles from the mouth of the Koree), and eastward to the Sindree\nLake. The guide was detained six days (from June 19th to 25th), during which time sixty-six shocks were counted. He then got across to Kotree, of which only a few small buildings on a bit of rising ground remained. Most of the habitations throughout the district must have been swept away, the best houses in Scinde being built of sun-dried bricks, and whole villages consisting only of huts made of a few crooked poles and reed mats. The guide traveled\ntwenty miles through water on a camel, the water up to the beast's body.

On that occasion, a tsunami occurred in the lake, the surges being large enough to cause problems for some children in the water on the opposite shore (Motutere?). \nWhile no waves or surges are mentioned in the account of the 1846 event, a taniwa [taniwha] is, i.e. The natives say that afterwards the Taniwa fled across the lake to Motutere and thence to Waikato, whence he will go to the sea and perish there; they shall be no more troubled with him; they saw the splash of his tail as lie crossed the lake (New Zealand Spectator & Cook's Strait Guardian 1 July 1846).  According to King et al. (2007), events involving large waves, storm surges and tsunamis were commonly explained as the work of taniwha in Maori traditional stories. In light of this, it is likely that the taniwha in the lake after the landslide in 1846 represents a tsunami. \nThe occurrence of a tsunami is given a validity of 3 (probable).\nInterestingly, the account indicates another landslide 10 years before 1846, before organised European settlement.

There are several accounts of sea level disturbances that have been interpreted as possible tsunami on three days during the 1848 earthquakes: October 16, i.e. the day of the mainshock; October 18 and October 19. According to Collinson (1848) \"eight hours after the first shock [which occurred on October 16 at 0140 local solar time], it being high water but neap tides, the tide rose in Wellington one foot [0.3 m] above ordinary spring tides\" i.e. the rise occurred on October 16 at about 9.40 am local solar time. Ironsides (1891) account indicating that the vagaries of the inflow and receding of the waters ... were remarkable, although included in the transcriptions is given little credence, as there is clear confusion in his full account of the earthquakes with the effects and uplift, and almost certainly the tsunami, that occurred in the 1855 earthquake. Hence, Collinson (1848) is the only contemporary account of a tsunami on the day of the mainshock, despite there being newspapers and other journal writers that recorded day-to-day events. The date in Collinsons account is almost certainly incorrect and should be October 18.\n<P>The lack of a tsunami being recorded at any time during the sequence of earthquakes, including the mainshock, is consistent with accounts written some years after the 1848. It is not clear whether these include locations other than Wellington. However, it is unlikely that a large tsunami and/or its effects, had they occurred near the source in Marlborough or along Wellingtons southern coast, were not observed despite the fact that few people lived there. Further, the lack of large or even moderate tsunami near the source is consistent with the lack of an observable tsunami within Wellington Harbour. On the other hand, it cannot be entirely ruled out that a small tsunami occurred. If a tsunami had been generated by the mainshock, it would have arrived in the Wellington City area an hour or so after the earthquake, on an ebbing tide about 2 hours after low tide. The occurrence of low tide could have masked the occurrence of a small tsunami. However, as many people lived on the beach in Lambton Harbour, and as they were disturbed by strong earthquake shaking, damage and aftershocks, they would surely have observed and commented upon any unusual repetitive ebbs and flows of the sea, had they been obvious, that is, exceeding 20-30 centimetres. \n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #79:</i></blockquote> \n<P>1848, Oct. 16-25 possible dates of tsunami. \n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #415:</i></blockquote> \n<P>1848, October 16, 01:40 [local time]. On October 16 at 1:40 [local time] the first of a series of shocks occurred in the region of Cook Strait. Eight hours after the earthquake, during a high water slack period, the water level in Wellington had risen 0.3 m higher than the mark of the highest flood tide. This effect, however, could have been caused not only by the earthquake but also by a strong southeast wind blowing on the 15th and 16th. Unusual changes in the sea level were noted also in Nelson and Wanganui." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 173.6, -41.9 ] } },

The following is an account of Sawkins (Sawkins, 1856; Perrey, 1861; Davis, 1928), about a very severe earthquake which may have been accompanied by a tsunami.\n<P>\"Several months prior to my arrival on the island of Tongatapu in 1854, an earthquake in the area had caused the northeast part of the island to subside, so that the ocean encroached here for 3 1/2 km (almost 2 miles) inland. Flooding occurred also, though to lesser extent, on the southeast coast of the island up to Nukualofa where, in a garden next to a completely demolished house, the water is now washing the roots of trees. The western shore of the island rose approximately one meter (several feet) and one of the springs that had been there previously disappeared underground.\n<P>\"Noteworthy also is the fact that the inundation of the northern and eastern shores, and the upheaval of the western and southern shores, was accompanied, at roughly the same time, by the appearance of a new island to the west. This fact was witnessed by many, including the captain of a whaling ship who previously had often sailed along that particular route and who, having grounded his ship on a sand bar near the new island, proceeded to land with a boat and crew on its western side. According to his account, the island was elevated about a decimetre (several inches) above the sea for a distance of 130 km (70 miles) and was covered with a black sand, exactly like the sand on the shores of other volcanic islands of this group and of the islands of Haapai. Moreover, hundreds of tons of sand were washing into the sea with each surf. I especially questioned the natives of Tongatapu whether they had previously seen anything similar to land in that direction, to which they replied negatively. The natives reckoned that the island had appeared on the very night when an earthquake had occurred (Christmas Eve, 1853) and when the ocean had inundated the land in Hihifo (Nord Point). \n<P>(above from reference #415)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -175.167, -21.167 ] } },

Validity 4 with some uncertainty on the date. A massive wave in Lituya Bay cleared trees to a height of 120 meters.  The occurrence of the wave is evidenced by a well-marked zone in the forest on either shore of the bay, the demarcation line of which separates two tree populations of differing ages.  Growth ring dating of the younger, lower trees indicated that a wave had cleared the forest between the growing season of August 1853 and May 1854. It is believed that the wave was generated by a rockslide on the south shore of the bay.  The report of many drowned at Dry Bay between 1850 and 1860 is probably associated with this tsunami. Native histories variously suggest from 8-10 war canoes with 8 men each were lost, to the loss of an entire village, as possible results of this event. It is tempting to combine these events with the poorly dated account of the 1845 glacier collapse in Disenchantment Bay and the 1847 Sitka earthquake. However, the tree-ring date for the Lituya Bay seems to fix that event to near the 1853-1854 period but an under-counting is possible. Therefore, these are considered as separate events [1845-1847 and 1853-1854]; the Lituya Bay event does not seem to have been associated with an earthquake. This is the earliest of five landslide tsunamis reported for Lituya Bay by Miller (1960). (Ref #239)\n<P>The following is from reference #415:\n<P>1853/1854. During studies in Lituya Bay, mainly in 1948 and in 1952-1953, clear traces of the past effects of a strong wave were found. Namely, along the northern and in places along the southern shore of the Bay, an age-old forest grew, beginning only at a certain well-marked boundary. Below this boundary and as far as the zone of flood tides, there grew only a young forest. Judging by the number of rings on trunk sections, it was established that the wave arose between the middle of August 1853 and the beginning of May 1854.\n<P>The maximal known height of this boundary is 120 m (395 feet) above mean sea level; the maximal distance from the water line is 750 m (2500 feet); the known area of the zone of destruction of forest is 3 1/2 km squared. Judging from the remaining traces of erosion, the destructive force of the wave of 1853/1854 was little less than that of the waves of 1958. \n<P>According to Indian legend, in the 60's of the XIX century, at the exit from Lituya Bay, eight canoes with people were lost in a sudden flood.

On a winter morning about 150 years ago, Hiro-mura village was hit by an earthquake. Upon seeing that the sea differed from usual the villagers evacuated to Hirohachiman Shrine, fearing a tsunami, but were relieved to see that no damage had occurred. However early afternoon of the next day, a villager rushed into Goryous home and said, \"It's a crisis! The well water has run dry!\" At 4:00 in the evening, a huge earthquake incomparable to the one of the previous day occurred. Houses fell down and roof tiles were blown off. People repeatedly heard sounds like the roar of cannons, and dark cirrus clouds rapidly spread. Finally a huge tsunami rushed toward the village. \"Run! Head up the hill! A tsunami is coming!\" Swallowed by the waves, Goryou frantically yelled at the villagers and urged them to evacuate to Hirohachiman Shrine. The tsunami traveled up the river washing away houses and agricultural fields, and then returned to the sea at frightening speed. Left around them was a hopeless sight. Adults and children alike were milling around calling for and trying to find their families. Goryou noticed there must be people wandering around in the dark, unsure of where to evacuate to. Suddenly he thought, \"I know, Ill set fire to the rice sheaves up on the hill, even if it is a bit wasteful,\" and he set fire to the rice sheaves. Drawn by the fire the villagers who had failed to escape then started arriving on the hill one after another. \"Oh, I was saved because of the fire.\" Just as the 9th villager reached the safety zone, a tsunami much bigger than before rushed toward the village and also extinguished the fire of rice sheaves." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 135.0, 33.1 ] } },

According to the captain, the shocks that were generated during the earthquake, which lasted over a minute, felt as if the ship was hitting rough bottom. Disembarking with his mate onto the beach, the captain became aware of a rapid succession of ebbs and flows. The waves were observed for at least 50 minutes, as they rolled over the shore of South Island. A \"terrible\" tidal wave rushed onto the shore. (reference #415) <P>The 1855 January 23 0932 UT 2111 Local time MW8.2-8.4 Wairarapa earthquake generated New Zealands largest historical locally-generated tsunami. The tsunami most affected the Cook Strait region, where the Wairarapa Fault and subsidiary faults (Wharekauhau Thrust and small play fault) ruptured beneath Cook Strait causing significant uplift (up to 6.4 m) of a large region west of the fault on the northern side of the strait and a small amount of subsidence on the southern side. The effects of the tsunami were observed at least as far north as Waikawa Beach, where fish were deposited above high water mark, and as far south as the Clarence River mouth and possibly Kaikoura, although evidence for the latter is equivocal. A bore in the Avon River attributed by De Lange & Healy (1986) to tsunami and the great sea wave in Otago harbour (Davie, 1870) were almost certainly seismically induced seiches, not tsunami. Seiches, often confused with tsunami on the coast, were observed in coastal rivers and estuaries at Wairoa (Hawkes Bay), Motupipi in Golden Bay, Kaiapoi and at Lyttelton, as well as in many inland water bodies. The greatest known height (10-11 m) reached by the tsunami was at Te Kopi in Palliser Bay, where a shed on a cliff 9 m above the sea was swept away. Here also, on the night of the earthquake and tsunami, a sailor who had experienced a tsunami in South America, persuaded a family to leave the shore. Nearby, at Whangaimoana, a tool that had been on the shore at the time of the earthquake was found many years later in a location 10 m above high water mark. High waves were also observed along the coast south of Wellington and along the Wairau Bar on the southern shore of Cook Strait, probably reaching 6-7 m near Rarangi. In Lyall Bay the tsunami swept about 2-2.5 km inland, inundating what is now the suburb of Miramar. The sea sweeping in from Lyall Bay (est. height above sea level at time, 4-5 m) reportedly met the water sweeping in from Evans Bay, on the Wellington Harbour side of Rongotai Isthmus (est. height above sea level at time 3-4 m). Within Wellington Harbour, water levels varied considerably. At Petone and along the road to the Hutt Valley, fish were deposited (the tide was high at the time of the earthquake) but the water levels do not seem to have reached much more than a metre or so above normal. However, the shops along the beach front at Lambton Quay (now on reclaimed land 200 m from the shore) were inundated with waves about 1.4-2.4 m above sea level at the time immediately after or during the earthquake. Barnett et al. (1991) (Grapes & Downes (1997)) separated the source of the tsunami within the harbour into three different components: the horizontal movement, causing an immediate slosh; differential vertical movement across the harbour; and the much greater deformation in Cook Strait and extending across the whole region west of the fault. For a local source tsunami, the duration seems to have been quite long, observations consistently indicating that in Wellington harbour and in Cook Strait water levels oscillated for 8-12 hours. It was also said that the tides were irregular for a week (see entries for January 24-31, January 24 and February 3).

There was a volcanic eruption in Unimak Pass. None of the effects describe organized wave action, and this is probably not a tsunami report. Validity 1 (Reference #239).\n<P>1856, July 26. There was a violent eruption in Unimak Pass, apparently near 54 deg 35 min N., 165 deg W. It is described by Neville, the captain of the whaler \"Alice Fraser.\" Crossing the pass on his ship with six other whalers, he observed that as a result of the volcanic eruption, enormous masses of dense black smoke were rising over the conical peaks of the mountains on the adjacent islands. He and the captains of the other whalers made ready to round the eastern tip of Unalaska Island, in order to get a good look at the eruption, which was accompanied by a prolonged dull roar and tremors, which by that time they had already felt repeatedly. At precisely this instant, the strong breeze which had been blowing completely died down, and the ships found themselves at the mercy of the eruption, in danger of being run aground. The eruption, lasting several hours with variable intensity, then appeared to reach its climax. The thunder of the eruption and the underground rumble rapidly intensified and became ever more ominous. The air was so still that dense black smoke was ejected straight up into the sky, without deviating in the slightest. It spread out above, at cloud level, and ashes, like flakes of snow, fell down in abundance. After 12 hours of still, a light breeze arose from the south, enabling the ships to move away from the volcano. But this breeze carried the column of smoke to the water surface, and a pitch darkness set in over a distance, as was later established, of more than 180 km, and the ships lost sight of the shore. The ashes fell like snow in a blizzard, covering the ships with gray substance from the deck to the top of the masts, blinding and choking all those on deck. Sailing west and north of the eastern shore, the ships tore out of the cloud of smoke. When they were near the northern base of the volcano, a prolonged dull rumble pealed out under them, and an underwater eruption occurred almost right in the centre of the flotilla. First the water churned and began to rise stormily in the form of disorderly waves. Then it rushed up, as if ejected from an enormous spring, forming a dazzling column of water of colossal height, which gradually disintegrated. Then a shaft of fire and smoke rose from the bottom upwards with peals of thunder. Lava and stones from a walnut to a cannon ball in size were disgorged, and fell on deck. This lasted no more than an instant, and the eruption ended as quickly as it had began. The water rushed into the abyss which had formed, forming a colossal whirlpool. The noise was like Niagara Falls. The ships rushed to safety, leaving the volcano in a state of regular alternation of relative calm and eruptions.

All the huts and the coconut trees surrounding them, were broken down and carried away by the tidal waves, and the inhabitants, men, women and children were drowned (it occurred during the night). A few men belonging to the village and who happened to be away at the time on a visit to some neighbouring village would not attempt to rebuild their huts on the old place, but went to live at Gumbu now Yeimas, also a coastal village but which had escaped destruction being built further inland. The destruction of Aralu was remembered by not very old people and it took place I suppose about the year 1856. The natives on the Maclay-Coast complained about the sickness in the villages on the coast which happened soon after the destruction of Aralu.

The day was clear and warm; the barometre 30 inches. Again on Monday night or strictly speaking Tuesday morning, the 22nd instant, another slight shock was felt; at half past three p.m. a second, and at ten minutes before five in the morning a third. The latter shock was by far the severest ever known in the colony; the whole earth moved like a huge wave, startling the people from one end of the district to the other.  The only damage done, yet ascertained, is the destruction of a brick oven on my farm; the fall of a portion of a stone chimney, a part breaking the roof of a stable; the cracking of a chimney on Andersons farm, at Black River; and a considerable in just to Mr Fords house at Highfields; and it was observed that the Prince of Wales schooner, lying at anchor at Duck Bay, had the bow rope taut and the stern fastening slack, immediately before the shock, whilst the reverse was the case directly afterwards, showing that the vessel had been moved several feet.\n<P>(above from reference #7675)\n<P>The Hobart Town Daily Mercury, 23 November 1859.

The shock as so great that women were running about in their night dresses not knowing what was the matter. The shock was preceded by a low rumbling noise which lasted a minute; it was then followed by a tremendous shaking, upsetting bottles and crockery and creating a great clatter... The course of the shock was from north to south as nearly as I could judge. This is the second severe shock that has been felt here within the last month. There was a severe shock felt here on Sunday at 3 p.m., and there were at least two previous shocks during the last night but not so severe as the one I have above mentioned.

The leading trough caused the ocean to recede from shores on all sides of the seismic convulsion. Produced as well, were the landslide tsunami at Guadeloupe and possible volcanic activity at St. Thomas and at Grenada.

Later, however, he quoted a ship captain's report from Pisagua on the same date that \"..the inhabitants cleared out to the mountains leaving another sea wave.\" The earlier tsunami thus implied might have occurred on one of the earlier dates shown in Aug. 1869 or might easily have been the tsunami of 1868 Aug. 13. Montessus de Ballore included in his provisional lists (1910-llb) a quake at Arica and Ica on Aug. 19 that was accompanied by a tsunami, but later (19lla) in detailed account omitted this date and described a Peru-N. Chile quake on Aug. 24 accompanied by a tsunami at Arica and Iquique. Fuchs (1870) mentions a tsunami only on Aug. 24 accompanying a quake at Iquique and Arica. It is considered probable that there was only one tsunami in Aug. 1869, that on the 24th, but possible that there was an additional one on the 19th.

A wide variety of sources were suggested by early investigators for the August 1872 tsunami, but Cox (Reference #65) determined from the difference in the tsunami arrival times at San Francisco and Honolulu that it originated on the Pacific shelf and slope of the eastern Aleutian Islands. The marigraphic evidence of its arrival at St. Paul Island permitted the time and location of its origin to be identified with greater certainty and precision than was possible earlier. Assuming the initial feature of the tsunami propagating southeastward to have been a crest, as considered most likely, its most probable origin time was estimated at about 18:06 UTC on 23 August, and the most probable position of the center of its origin area was estimated at about 52.2N, 168.5W.

Remarks by de Miklouho- Maclay, 1884 (ref #12433). The natives told me that during my absence they had experienced on the coast and the mountains several earthquakes, on which occasions some natives were killed by the falling of cocoanut trees in the villages, which in falling destroyed the huts. The villages on the coast suffered more on account of unusually big waves which followed soon after the earthquake, breaking down the cocoanut trees and sweeping away a few huts nearest to the beach. In revisiting the coast villages, I found many not unimportant changes: stretches of destroyed forest by tidal waves after the earthquake; alteration in the direction of some small streams, the old mouths of which had been closed by bars of sand left behind by waves.

Tarapaca, Mamina, Pica, La Horia, La Tarama, Conchones, and Punta Lobos were more or less destroyed [7]. At Caleta Pabellon de Pica, the earthquake lasted 5 minutes with increasing force. More than 10 fires were started by overturned lamps. The fires were extinguished by the flood. <B>Thirty-three workers died in a\nlandslide</B>. Furniture and lamps were overturned; fires broke out.

It was supposedly observed by two ships, the Pretty Jane and the SS Go Ahead, which were respectively off East Cape and Waipiro Bay (historically known as Open Bay). However, it is probable that some confusion has occurred with the names of the ships, and they were in fact the same ship.\nThe disturbance, which was less than 400 m across, was visible in front of the ship and to seaward and was moving towards the ship faster than it could steam.  The main disturbance was successfully avoided. Nevertheless the ship was tossed and pitched about until it reached smooth water. \nNewspaper accounts note that a slight earthquake was felt in Gisborne about 12-24 hours previously. Gregg (1958), in analysing the reports, suggests the disturbance was a tsunami resulting from submarine landslides or faulting connected with the earthquake felt at Gisborne. There are no accounts of a tsunami reaching the coast in newspapers of the day. While earthquake faulting could cause such a disturbance, the earthquakes occurrence is too early and almost certainly too small, although it may have acted as a trigger. A more plausible explanation is a small submarine landslide, or an expulsive gas emission.\nThe event is given a validity of 2, as it is possible that a small tsunami was generated, but the source was too small and too localised for the tsunami to reach land at an observable height. The event is primarily recorded in the database to document the occurrence of localised disturbances at sea which may have been caused by gas hydrate emission, the larger events of this sort having been identified as possible tsunami generators.

The tsunami did no damage around the Bay of Bengal where tide gauges recorded a maximum amplitude of 0.8 m (Oldham, 1884). An analysis of five tide gauge records reveals that the earthquake was Mw = 7.9 <u>+</u>0.2 and occurred on an east-dipping thrust fault below and to the west of Car Nicobar, an island at 9 deg N midway between the Andaman and Nicobar islands (Ortiz and Bilham, 2003). GPS measurements at Port Blair indicate oblique convergence of the plate boundary (Paul et al., 2001). The earthquake is believed to have occurred on the interface between the Indian and Andaman Plates and the inferred mechanism of\nwestward slip of the hanging wall slip is consistent\nwith slip partitioning between the dipping subduction zone, and the strike-slip west Andaman fault east of Car Nicobar.\n<P>A feature of this earthquake is the inferred presence of a region of minor slip NE of the main rupture zone. This may have been a secondary secondary earthquake triggered by the mainshock. Its timing would have to have occurred within a few minutes of the mainshock for it to have produced the sea wave observed at Port Blair. Local\npopulations were concentrated in only two islands and therefore there is no corroboration of this inferred northern region of submarine faulting which occurred between them. It is probable that offshore corals may be of use in reconstructing an extended history of earthquakes in\nthe Andaman-Nicobar Islands. The island of Car Nicobar is believed to have been raised and tilted during the 1881 event.

A 3m tsunami affected the San Blas Coast of Northern Panama; between 75 and 100 were drowned (reference #273).\n<P>1882, Sept. 7, about 3:00 [local time]. There was an earthquake at Panama, stronger than any previously known. Sieberg (1932), in giving the basic data on the earthquake, reports that it was accompanied by tsunami waves which were observed from Panama to Guayaquil [source of information unknown]. Iida (reference #79) surmises, without much evidence, that two earthquakes occurred: one in Panama and Nicaragua, the other in Colombia. [\"Tsunami wave in Guayaquil\" is an incorrect translation of \"Seismic wave down to Guayaquil\" in Sieberg, reference #1576, listed below] (reference #415)\n<P>1882, Sept. 7. Destruction in the city of Panama, several deaths. Also felt on the islands and a tsunami. Cable breaks. Damage suffered the landward towns, even Colon. Felt in Nicaragua to Greytown, North Colombia and Venezuela to Caracas. Seismic wave down to Guayaquil. Numerous, partly final aftershock to 1883. (ref #1576).\n<P>A large tsunami associated with the earthquake swept the San Blas Islands in northern Panama on 7 September 1882, killing about 65 people (Star and Herald, 1882; Nelson, 1889). A newspaper article that appeared in the Star and Herald (1882) of Panama City on 11 October 1882 contains a firsthand account of the tsunami damage. The article is based on details provided to the governor by one of the island inhabitants and contains the following statements:\n\". . . the tide ran out a great distance, and on its return, swept away the villages built on the beaches of the different islands of the archipelago and on the mainland. The outflow and inflow occurred four times a day, the greatest damage being done by the third wave. The villages of Rio Coco, Isla Paloma, Napacandi, on the islands of the same name, were swept away, and more than forty persons were drowned. At Playon Grande, every house was washed down,\nbut only two persons were drowned. Playon Chico, which adjoins it, also suffered. All the produce stored at Rio Mono was swept away, but no lives were lost. The chief loss of produce, however, has taken place at Aguili Candi island\n. . . Sixteen persons lost their lives there, and several thousand dollars worth of imported goods were swept into the sea. The villages of Rio Banana and Mosquito have also been flooded, the people left homeless, and their goods destroyed. \"Although the sea was observed to be relatively calm at Colon, the Canal Company tidal gauge located offshore registered a distinct tsunami with a maximum height of 62 cm (Bulletin du Canal Interoceanique, 1882; Nelson, 1889). At Miguel de la Borda, the tide rose and flooded beach houses (Star and Herald, 1882). Because subsidence was extensive in the area, however, the tsunami effects at Miguel de la Borda cannot be accurately estimated. The submarine telegraph cable between Col6n and Jamaica broke during the earthquake (Star and Herald, 1882; De Montessus de Ballore, 1888; Nelson, 1889).

The explosion of the Krakatau Volcano in Indonesia generated a 30-m tsunami in the Sundra Strait that destroyed numerous towns and killed about 36,000 people. The explosion was heard about 3,000 miles away. It also caused an atmospheric pressure wave that was recorded on the tide gages at remote locations including South Georgia Island, Panama, France, England, Hawaii, Alaska, and San Francisco. Due to the shadowing by continents and island groups, a direct tsunami could not have reached most of these locations. Harkrider and Press (1967) show that the direct air waves (acoustic) are the first to be recorded. Atmospheric gravity waves with phase and group velocities nearer the oceanic gravity wave velocity (sqrt(gd)) occurred and may have excited water waves (tsunamis) by transferring energy to the ocean. The longer the fetch, the more energy that would be transferred.\nThese waves are the most energetic and are created beyond the land mass shadow zones. The initial acoustic waves, too, may create resonances in the coastal and harbor areas as seiches. To consider these to be true tsunamis is a stretch of the definition but atmospheric gravity waves are or may be a source for tidal disturbance which resemble tsunamis.

Many other vessels were badly shaken and strained by the wave, but there is no means of communicating with them. Up the harbor the wave overturned small boats, parted the fastening of small vessels, and did damage to the New Haven Yacht Club.

There was a powerful eruption of the Awu Volcano on Sangihe Island, which generated, so far as can be judged from the fragmentary data, joint gravitational oscillations of the atmosphere and the hydrosphere of the same type as the waves from the Krakatau explosion and corresponding oscillations in level [seiche type?] in the internal seas in Indonesia.<P>The eruption began at 18:10 without any preliminary phenomena. A huge column of smoke rose over the volcano. Lightning flashed. It rained with a mixture of ashes. This soon became a real ash and rock fall.\n<P>The explosion of the volcano was not accompanied by noticeable tremors of the island. The eruption reached extraordinary power at about 21:00. After this, the fall of pumice stopped, and the ashfall also diminished by midnight. Soon after the eruption, boiling mud flows saturated with hydrogen sulfide, presumably formed as a result of the emptying of the crater lake, rushed along the crevices which furrowed the slopes of the volcano. As a result of the eruption, <B>1,532 people died</B> on the island, or 2% of its population, since many huts collapsed under the weight of ejecta, while others were washed away by the streams. The northern part of the island suffered considerably more than the southern. Gardens, kitchen-gardens, and coconut plantations were buried.<P>The loud noises of the explosions of the volcano were heard on\nTernate Island from 18:00 to 22:00 and then at night until 2:00. At Manado, several explosions were heard for half an hour after 18:30, and flames flickered on the horizon to the north. At Tolitoli and Donggala, and also at many parts in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Island, including Makassar and Maros and on Timor\nIsland, at 19:30 and later, very faint muffled booms were heard, like distant artillery fire. Similar sounds were heard at 20:30 at Ambon and at night on Flores Is., at Larantuka.<P>The sound wave was followed by a gravitation wave, which caused perceptible tremors at a number of places. Prolonged faint trembling of the ground was felt in the evening on Ternate Is. At Makassar at 1:57, tremors 3-4 degrees in strength were registered. Similar oscillations were registered at Maros and in general in the southern and eastern regions of Sulawesi Is. and on Kabia Is. At Bima, on Sumbawa Is., very strong horizontal oscillations were felt from 2:05 to 2:15, and very weak [ground] waves were felt at 5:10 and at 8:10. Several huts collapsed on Flores Is. at Reo. At Maumere, horizontal oscillations lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one hut collapsed. At Ende, strong oscillations were felt at 1:00. At Larantuka, horizontal tremors lasting 2 minutes were felt at 2:30; one residence collapsed.<P>At Surabaja at 1:34, the pendulum of the astronomical clock stopped.<P>At Djakarta (Batavia), the magnetograph registered an earthquake at 1:17 and then at 1:21 and 6:00.<P>Oscillations in sea level were noticed at Bonthain, Bulukumba and Salajar; the only consequence was minor damage to one boat in the Tanga River at Bonthain.<P>At Bima, oscillations in level were noticeable at 3:00. The water rose high at the entrance to the bay; this was accompanied by a loud noise, which was even heard in the home of the local superintendent, a 2-hour walk away. This rustling lasted 20 minutes, after which the water began to rise very quickly. The highest rise of water was observed at 5:00, when there should have been an ebb.<P>A weak tsunami was observed at 7:00 in Ambon Bay. In a few minutes, the water level oscillated from the highest to the lowest level, with a range of more than 1.5 m.\n<P>The ashes ejected during the explosion settled on a considerable area to the south of Sangihe Is. A ship traveling to Sangihe Is. from Ternate Is. was covered with ashes; ashes fell on Likupang. At Donggala and Makassar, much ash fell on the 8th from 3:00 until sunset." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 125.5, 3.67 ] } },

The ship heaved and trembled for over a minute. The motion was slight but marked, and was very like the motion imparted to the ship by the action of the screw when it is reversed and the fore part of the ship is aground. So far as I saw, the shock did not affect the surface of the sea near the vessel. <P>On our arrival at Kavatari next morning we found that the earthquake had been felt on shore at that place. It had caused the trees to sway and a cavity had been formed near the village. The cavity, a few yards in diameter and about four feet deep at its deepest part, had apparently been due to the giving way of the covering of an underground hollow.\n<P>On the following day we reached the island of Sim-Sim and learned that earthquake shocks had been felt in the evening of March 6th, and that the island had also suffered from a wave of the sea. The account given us by a native of the earthquake and the wave was this: A little after sunset they experienced a shock, then followed a loud booming sound apparently not very far off, then another shock. After this there was a lull for a short time, and then they heard the noise of the advancing wave, which almost immediately afterwards swept over the flat. The waters knocked the frail native houses down and swept portions of them, together with household goods, into the sea. <B>One little child was drowned</B>, and one man we saw that received some severe abrasions of the skin. \n<P>A native of Buna village, says that 'about 11 years ago (1895) the water came up in the same way but very much higher, and he gave me the <B>names of 26 people of Buna who lost their lives</B>. A report states 'My information indicates that it was a true earthquake-induced tidal wave or tsunami - the sea receded some distance before the wave came in. The wave traveled inland some 4 miles south to about the area of Ononda. I interviewed MacKenzie on 14.9.71. He was not able to tell me a lot except that his father was a small boy at the time, and that the <B>wave was probably about 20 ft high</B> and it had left Nixon in some thorn bushes.' <P>When we reached Cape Vogel on March 21, we learned from the natives there that a short time back a great wave had struck the shore, apparently in Porlock Bay. News of the catastrophe had come down the coast to Cape Vogel. The natives could not give the date, but the time they gave was a little after dark, which corresponds with the time the water swept on Sim-Sim. The natives said that <B>four small villages in Porlock Bay which are close to each other were washed away and some people drowned</B>. \n<P>(above from reference #99)\n<P>Reports indicate that the tsunami was very localised and/or directional, the water receded first then returned as a 6m high tsunami at Sim-Sim yet no impact was observed on Kawa only 20km away. A great wave was reported in Porlock Bay on the Papuan Peninsula west of the Trobriand\nIslands where four villages were washed away, some of the villagers drowned. At Buna it is reported that 26 people drowned (Everingham, 1977). We have assumed the tsunami height there was 3 to 5m to cause the damage reported.

The distance from where the debris went into the sea across the bay to where the wave struck is not less than half a mile, and it is said that some of the rocks lifted by its force and hurled across the road are over 200 pounds in weight.

A strong earthquake in Sanriku, Honshu Island, was felt over an enormous area and generated a catastrophic tsunami. According to official accounts, 10,617 buildings were washed away, 27,122 people died, and 9,247 people were injured... The tsunami was observed at least from the south of Hokkaido Island to the Bonin Islands, and also on the Hawaiian Islands and in North America. The Sanriku coast on a stretch of more than 400 km from Kinkazan Island in the south to Cape Shiriya in the north, suffered most of all.\n<P>At most places on the Sanriku coast, the tsunami began with a noticeable ebb tide. The exact time of the beginning of the ebb tide in the pleistoseismic area is unknown. According to the data of the hydrometeorological station at Miyako and the accounts of some eyewitnesses, the ebb tide began at nightfall, 15-30 minutes after the earthquake. The first tidal wave arrived immediately after 20:00. Consequently, the time difference between the beginning of the ebb tide and the arrival of the tidal wave was 30 minutes. The magnitude of the ebb tide naturally depended on the depth of the sea: in shallows, the water retreated a great distance, while at deep places, it retreated a small distance. Thus the water retreated 350 m at Horiuchi, 350-550 m at Ryoisi and Ooya, 500 m at Minatohama and 35 m at Tadaide.<P>Before the flood tide, a loud rumble like thunder or the noise of a squall could be heard from far at sea. The wave appeared simultaneously with the rumble on the coast of Kesen district, Iwate Prefecture, while it appeared soon after the rumble at other places. It is said that it was even heard in the prefectures of Akita and Yamagata.<P>It is also very difficult to establish the time of arrival of the tidal wave. The time, estimated by the hydrometeorological station at Miyako, 20:07 can be considered the most precise. According to the report of this station, the tsunami began 18 minutes after the first underground shock. A flood tide began at about 20:00, and a wave of great height, accompanied by a loud rumble, arrived at 20:07. Then the flood tides recurred six times: at 20:15, 20:32, 20:48, 20:59, 21:16 and 21:50. The second, the largest wave, washed away many people and carried\nhomes out to sea.<P>The average period of oscillations on the Sanriku coast after the arrival of the tsunami was about 15 minutes. The intensity of the waves began to gradually abate after 22:00, but small oscillations in sea level were still being observed at noon of the following day. The greatest height of rise of water was registered at Yoshihama and Ryori. The second, greatest wave was 24 m high at Yoshihama and the water rose 30 m at Ryori.<P>On June 15, the residents of the prefectures on the Sanriku coast were celebrating a national holiday in the streets; there was no work that day. After the ebb tide, with which the tsunami began, some hurried away from the water, but the majority continued the festivities. Practically the entire population of the flooded zone, except for a few individuals miraculously spared, perished in the roller which fell on the Sanriku coast. In addition, the fishermen who had gone out to sea were saved; returning home in the morning, knowing nothing about the events, they saw a horrible picture: the sea was strewn with debris of homes and corpses for several km from shore and heaps of ruins or bare expanses remained in place of the previous coastal villages and cities.\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \n<P>1896, June 15, (19:33 local time). 39.5 N, 144 E, magnitude 7.6, Sanriku. 26,360 deaths (22,000 deaths by Yamashita), more than 11,000 homes wrecked and washed away.

There was a destructive earthquake on the southwest of the Philippine Islands, with a maximum intensity of VIII (IX Rossi-Forel). \n<P>The steamship \"Brutus\", situated near Zamboanga, felt a strong seaquake. Waves arose, moving to the east and breaking on shore near Zamboanga about 10 minutes later.\n<P>At Zamboanga, about 15:00 (local time), an earthquake recurred with the same force as the preceding one.\nThen a phenomenon occurred which caused great panic. The sea level fell 5 m, and then rose and fell with great speed. After several such oscillations in level, sea waves began to flood the city, although they did not advance further than the first few homes. The water picked up proas riding off shore and left them high and dry. According to eyewitnesses, the greatest oscillations in level were observed from 15:00 to 16:00, and at 16:00, the second of the strongest waves arrived. The phenomenon lasted a little less than 2 hours.\n<P>At Isabela, about half an hour after the earthquake, water burst with a roar into the northeastern passage leading to the port. The enormous waves moving from the west washed away everything on shore; the sea level rose at least 7 m above the usual mark. The sea rose and fell more than 30 times, and one of the waves was considerably larger than the others. The waves broke on shore with such force that they easily rolled building timber 6 m long and pieces of masonry. A grocery store was washed away, 25 homes were destroyed, and the gunboat General Laso was imperiled.\n<P>There were victims on the farms of the Moro tribe: at Panigayan, two injured: at Balauan, five dead, six injured; at Labotan, three dead, six injured; at Matiban, five dead, homes destroyed; eight homes were washed away at Tagu.\n<P>An eyewitness on a boat riding at anchor in Sibuguey Bay, related that the water raised the boat together with its two anchors several times and the ship was in great danger.\n<P>At Dapitan Port, the sea rose 2 m at the head of the bay.\n<P>At Negros Island, at noon a boat was crossing the bay; its movements were almost totally paralyzed by the waves.\n<P>On Jolo Island, 15 minutes after the earthquake, the sea began to rise and fall at 15 minute intervals, retreating 200-250 m from shore. The maximum height of rise of water was 1 m. The rough sea calmed by 21:30 (L.T.).\n<P>On Siau Island, Indonesia, the first drop in level was observed 1.5 hours after the earthquake. In 1/2 hour, the water retreated far beyond the ebb tide mark. Then it returned, reaching the flood tide mark in a few minutes. <P>Tsunami reports also came from the north coast of Calimantan island (Kudat region) and from the eastern shore of Sumatra Island.\n<P>Between Labuan Island and the coast of Calimantan Island, where the depth of the water had been 6 m, a new little island quietly rose out of the water after 13:00 on the 21st. The island was made up of clay and pebbles and was 200 m long, 150 m wide, and 20 m high. Its surface gave off hot gases and there was  a strong petroleum smell. It is possible that the island was built up by the tsunami waves; on the other hand, the island could have also been the result of an underwater mud eruption.\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #1072:</i></blockquote> \n<P>A tsunami claimed claimed hundreds of victims on the western shores of Basilan. \n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #1058:</i></blockquote> \n<P>100 victims due to the tsunami." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 122.0, 6.0 ] } },

E. C. Forrest. Mr. Forrest was formerly a missionary belonging to the Melanesian Mission, and settled in the Santa Cruz islands. Some time ago he resigned from the mission, and took up commercial pursuits, island life having an attraction for him.  As the group is comparatively seldom called at by passing vessels news rarely reaches Sydney from there; but the Ysabel pays Mr. Forrest's station a visit about four times a year.  She was there nearly three months ago and will return on her next outward trip from Sydney about a week hence. Mr. Forrest has written to Mr. Mitchell, of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. an account of a phenomenal experience he had in the <B>latter part of March</B>. It was a sudden outbreak of a volcano, which was followed by an overwhelming tidal wave.  Santa Cruz Islands, seven in number, are notable as being the scene of the disastrous loss of the two ships Boussole and Astrola, of La Perouse, in 1788, an event which was not ascertained with any certainty until May, 1826, or 38 years afterwards. Santa Cruz Island [Nendo Island], on which Mr. Forrest resides, is the principal of the group, and it was here that natives attacked the boats of H.M.S. Pearl, under Commodore Goodenough, in August, 1875, and with their poisoned arrows fatally wounded the much respected Commodore. Mr. Forrest describes how the volcano burst forth with smoke and flame, emitting ashes, and all but ruining his plantations. At night there was a fearful roar out to seaward, and soon after a huge sea broke on the coast, smashing his trading craft into splinters, washing away the copra-house and demolishing his store of copra and cocoanuts, completing in fact the work of destruction left unfinished by the seismic disturbance. At the time of writing Mr. Forrest was not informed of what loss of life inland amongst the natives as a result of the eruption had taken place or what the effect of the tidal wave had elsewhere been on the Santa Cruz coast, but he fears, as the island is thickly populated, some fatalities have happened. The group is a volcanic one, and before contained an active volcano upon an uninhabited island not far from Santa Cruz.

Eddies formed in the bay, in which trees, driftwood and all kinds of rubbish circled so rapidly that it was difficult to follow individual objects. The water foamed up and was covered with whitecaps on the whole expanse. Reaching the chute of the sawmill, the whirlpool tore it off and carried it away in an instant.</br>\n<br>According to another eyewitness, after the earthquake the water in the bay began to retreat stormily and passed the line of the lowest low tides.

The vessel was then shifted out half a mile into deep water. Captain Tornaros learned afterwards from Mr. Hernsheim that they believed the island Malapia had been lifted four feet.

During the upheaval the sea receded fully 50 feet from the shore, and after an interval of ten minutes rushed in again.

On 26 February at 19 h local time (27 February 00 h 36 m UT) a tidal wave flooded the coast of Ahuachapan in El Salvador from Garita Palmera to Barra del Paz and beyond, a distance of about 120 km. The height of the wave is not mentioned, but allegedly about 100 persons were drowned at San Diego and 85 at Barra del Paz. Some property damage was caused on the coast of Acajutla and Cara Sucia. Some writers associate this event with a spurious earthquake on 1902 February 26 (Cruz & Wyss 1983, reference #82) or with the earthquake of 1903 April 19. However, there is evidence that this <I><B>wave was not triggered by an earthquake, but rather that it was the result of a combination of a high tide and abnormal meteorological conditions</I></B> (Anderson 1908, reference #7975; List 1903, reference #8016). Most of the earthquakes associated with seismic sea waves are located just off the coast or a few tens of km inland at distances from the shore comparable with their source dimensions. It is not clear whether these waves were due to tectonic movements of the seabed; the evidence for some off the southeast coast of Costa Rica points to submarine slumping or to their being seiches set up in Fonseca, Nicoya and Chiriqui bays.

On February 26, the residents of the Pacific coast border regions of Guatemala and El Salvador heard a loud rumble, like cannon shots, which appeared to come from under the bottom of the sea. A strong earthquake then occurred. Soon the residents saw the water retreating, exposing the sea bottom for a considerable distance. After this, a black wall arose at sea: this was a large wave, whose might increased as it approached the shore. The wave surged onshore with terrifying force. The residents did not have time to run to safety and they perished. The tsunami was observed on a 120-km stretch of coast which included Acajutla, Ecuador. <B>One hundred people died and about the same number were injured</B> at Barra de Santiago settlement.

A FLAMING CRATER. HORROR IN GUATEMALA.

The subsequent earthquakes were, in his opinion, the result of interior explosions of the steam thus generated, and the final eruption that has devastated the Santa Maria region is ascribed to a last gigantic effort of this imprisoned vapor to burst its fetters. On September 27 a tidal wave rolled in upon the coast of\nGuatemala, concentrating upon the shore at Ocos, north of Champerico, where it destroyed the pier and washed away the beach, tearing the ocean bed to a depth of seven fathoms, where the lead had previously sounded only five fathoms.

The volcano Matavanu on the island of Savaii (Samoan Islands) was active between August 4, 1905, and November. Huge streams of lava up to one cubic km in volume emerged, one of which moved in a northeasterly direction and reached the ocean shore, a distance 12 km from the crater on December 6, 1905. Fields and villages situated in the path of the lava stream were destroyed. From time to time the lava tongues fell into the water and gave rise to small tsunami-type waves (including at the end of 1906 and in 1907). One of the phases of the eruption was observed by the missionary, John Farlong. According to his account, after some periods marked by earth tremors, on August 4, 1908, two yawning fissures appeared from which clouds of steam, illuminated by flames and eruptive material, shot up with explosive force. The streams of lava moved at a rate of 900 m (1/2 mile) in a 24 hour period, and at the points where the lava fell into the sea huge columns of steam rose, several times in the same area. They were 450 m (500 yards) in length and inundated the land for a distance of 90-110 m (100-120 yards). According to observers, the appearance of the waves coincided with increasing volcanic activity. (reference #415)\n<P>1905-1911. The Matavanu volcano eruption first began on August 4 of 1905.

According to observations at Finsh Harbor, about 15 minutes after the earthquake the sea \"began to rumble\" and a larger roller surged in, as a result of which the water level rose 1.2-1.5 m above the flood tide mark. The lowlying part of the coast was flooded, and the dike between the land and Madang Island, which was built of large coral blocks, was washed out. \"Freezing\" for 1/2 minute, the flood tide receded just as quickly and unexpectedly as it had appeared and the subsequent ebb tide was a good 1.5 m lower than the strongest equinoctial ebb tides.

According to observations in Finschhafen, the sea roared enormously for about 15 min after the first tremor and a spring tide appeared. The water level rose to 1.2 to 1.5 m above highest sea-level mark, and the low-lying coastal areas were flooded;a causeway constructed from massive coral blocks from the mainland to the island of Madang was completely washed away. After remaining at the highest level for half a minute, the flood ran off as quickly as it appeared. After remaining at the highest level for about half a minute, the flood ran of as quickly as it appeared. The following low tide was about 1.5 m below the normal spring low tide during the change of the monsoon. The high tide returned several times; the unusual low tide remained until 10 a.m. Thereafter the water level rose slowly to normal. The natives from the island villages, Quamquam, Sisalum, etc., fled from the flood wave to the mainland and did not return to their villages for days. Especially important may be the report from Missionary J.S. Pfalzer (observation by Missionary Hansche) that no flood wave occurred on the island of Ruk; on the contrary the water retreated there. Is there not a possibility that sudden submarine slumping may have caused the movement of the water masses? Also Missionary G. Bamler locates the epicentre between Kaiser Wilhelm Land and Neu-Pommern and considers a block down thrust. In this connection it also remarkable that according to Missionary Hansche, on the day before the earthquake, on September 14th, smoke emerged from the volcano on the island of Tupinier. \n<P>1906, Sept 15, 01:30 [local time].

The volcano Matavanu on the island of Savaii (Samoan Islands) was active between August 4, 1905, and November. Huge streams of lava up to one cubic km in volume emerged, one of which moved in a northeasterly direction and reached the ocean shore, a distance 12 km from the crater on December 6, 1905. Fields and villages situated in the path of the lava stream were destroyed. From time to time the lava tongues fell into the water and gave rise to small tsunami-type waves (including at the end of 1906 and in 1907). One of the phases of the eruption was observed by the missionary, John Farlong. According to his account, after some periods marked by earth tremors, on August 4, 1908, two yawning fissures appeared from which clouds of steam, illuminated by flames and eruptive material, shot up with explosive force. The streams of lava moved at a rate of 900 m (1/2 mile) in a 24 hour period, and at the points where the lava fell into the sea huge columns of steam rose, several times in the same area. They were 450 m (500 yards) in length and inundated the land for a distance of 90-110 m (100-120 yards). According to observers, the appearance of the waves coincided with increasing volcanic activity. (reference #415)\n<P>1907, October 6. According to Anderson (1910, reference #4097), the largest and most important tsunami that was caused by the Matavanu volcano eruption occurred on October 6, 1907 at about 5:30 p.m. local time. The largest and most important of the series was that on Sunday, October 6th, 1907, at about 5:30 p.m. It was just at the time of high water, but the sea was smooth. The wave was 10 or 12 feet high; it came from the north-east round the lave-point, as in fact the others had done, and at the Deutsche Handels & Plantagen Gesellschaft's place a boat-house was wrecked, a buggy in it smashed, and several boats were damaged; while, at a house a few score yards off, a 400-gallon tank of water was lifted bodily from its foundation and carried across the road. The wave appears to have spent itself here and, it was thought, probably rebounded out to sea. No damage was done at the Government Offices, 150 yards distant, nor in either direction along the coast. The wave was noticed, but of smaller size, in some of the other islands. At Apia it had a height of only 1or 2 feet. It was probably connected with the lava falling into the sea , but the exact cause was uncertain. Possibly it was due to a steam explosion.

Most of these waves did not exceed 6 to 8 feet in height, and as many of them occurred at low or half-tide, and there was no heavy sea on at the time, little damage was done, although in several cases the main road of the town was flooded.\n\n(above from reference #337)\n\n<P>For more information link to the the \n<B><U><a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/idb/struts/results?EQ_0=1326&t=101650&s=9&d=99,91,95,93&nd=display\"','tsueqWindow','resizable=yes,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600,left=5,top=50', target=\"blank\"); \">tsunami event</a></B></U> and \n<B><U><a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/idb/struts/results?EQ_0=2068&t=102557&s=1&d=140,145,175,180&nd=display\"','tsueqWindow','resizable=yes,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600,left=5,top=50', target=\"blank\"); \">volcanic eruption</a></B></U> on August 4, 1905." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -172.525, -13.612 ] } },

A report from Haines\nsaid that the Davidson Glacier was moved a half\nmile by the shock (Alaska Daily Dispatch,\nSeptember 24, 1907, p. 1). Captain Nyland of the\nPetrel, which was four miles north of Haines,\nobserved a slight temporary change in water\nlevel, (Tarr and Martin, 1912, p. 96). The\nearthquake was recorded on the seismograph at\nSitka, and Soloviev and Go (1975, p. 216-217)\nestimate the magnitude to have been 5.5 based\non the small record there. They believe the water\nchange was seiche as the magnitude was small.\nHowever, landslides and ice falls could be\nassociated with small-to-moderate earthquakes.\nSeiche, if they are possible at all in the\nearthquake source region, are not usually found\nwith small earthquakes.\n<P>The report of cable disruptions by the cable ship\nBurtiside states that it was advised of a cable\ninterruption to the Sitka-Valdez cable on the\nmorning of October 2 and repaired a break on\nOctober 6 caused by submarine upheaval. It\nis believed that this interruption was caused by\na submarine upheaval as advices afterwards\nreceived from the Weather Bureau at Sitka show\nthat a seismic disturbance occurred west of that\nstation at the time the cable became interrupted.\nAs there is not another earthquake reported for\nthe following week this cable break is probably\nfor the event of September 25.

Fourteen of the breaks\noccurred near Wrangell and were caused by\nsubmarine movement from the sediments in the\nStikine River. Four of these were associated with\nearthquakes. Except for the 1949 and 1957\nevents, none produced reports of any wave\nactivity. Similarly, fourteen cable breaks\noccurred near Haines and Skagway. Many were\nassociated with the deltas from the Katzehin\nRiver and Skagway River. Four of these were\nassociated with earthquakes, and only those of\n1958 and 1964 had observed waves with them.\nTen more cable breaks were associated with\nValdez and the delta of the Lowe and Robe\nRivers. Six of these were associated with\nearthquakes, including those of 1908 (see\nfollowing event), 1925, and 1949, which were\nobserved (Heezen and Johnson, 1969; National\nArchives, Alaska Region, Record Group 342).

A seaquake was felt on a ship situated 7 km (4 miles) north of Haines, and a small temporary change in the water level was noticed. [These were probably seiches.

The wave inundated many places causing severe damage to harbor infrastructures, boats and houses.  All piers in the harbor lowered and some of them collapsed. Most damage in the southern beach of the city, close to the Portalegna stream. The english cemetery was completely destroyed. Many boats were carried onshore and destroyed. Many vessels moored in the harbor felt a sudden considerable sea level rise just a few minutes after the shock, and some of them broke their mooring. According to the Harbor Office report, the tsunami occurred 8 min after the shock. At least three huge waves were observed, the first was the biggest.  Water  height reached about 3 m. <P><blockquote><i>Reference #516:</i></blockquote> <P><P>On both sides of the Strait, many buildings were swept away by the waves. In Sicily, 79 people were drowned, and, on the Calabrian coast, more than 141. <P><blockquote><i>Reference #5096:</i></blockquote> <P>Guidoboni et al (2007) contend that <B>80,000 people were killed by the earthquake, including as many as 2,000 who died as a result of the tsunami</B>. Waves up to 12 m struck the shorelines south of Messina and south of Reggio Calabria, displacing the rubble from collapsed buildings and completing the destruction. All communications in the affected area were disrupted, and rescue operations had to rely on access from the sea. <P><blockquote><i>Reference #10248:</i></blockquote> <P>The 28 Dec 1908 Messina earthquake was one of the most destructive events in Italy and was associated with one of the largest tsunami inundations in recent history. About 60 000 people died because of the earthquake and about 1500 were killed by the tsunami. The cities of Messina and Reggio-Calabria were damaged extensively. The tsunami run-up was 3m in the Messina harbour and as high as 13m in the village of Pellaro, and the tsunami waves entered 200m inland in several locations along the coast of the Messina Straits." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 15.58, 38.17 ] } },

It is now announced that no storm occurred there, but that the flooding followed on a rush of the tide. It is probable that a volcanic disturbance took place in the seabed miles distant from Nome, and thus the abnormal tide was formed. In the rush of the tide schooners were driven ashore. If icebergs had been as far southward as usual they would have dashed against the buildings of the streets on the waterfront. (reference #7596)\n<P>Much Property Destroyed and Many Lives Lost [?], Nome, Alaska, November 5. A violent submarine earthquake or volcanic eruption is thought to be the cause of a great tidal wave which swept the Nome coast, flooding that city and causing heavy damage to shipping. Although there was <b>no loss of life</b>, 90 residents of the lowlands along the beach saw all their belongings swept away, and barely escaped with their lives. Great waves swept away the frail structures along the beach and carried many small coasting vessels far up on the beach. The flood came without warning. There was complete calm at the time, but the waves were of a giant size, as though raised by a hurricane. No reports of earthquakes have been received, but for several months Mount Bogosloff and Mount Shishalden, near Unemak pass, have been spouting fire and lava at short intervals, and the Bogosdloff lands have been undergoing peculiar contortions. Reports are anxiously awaited from other points along the coast. (reference #7595)\n<P>...I was born in Nome Alaska December 29th, 1904 on the Sand Spit.  We lived in a small cabin outside of Nome which was between the Bering Sea and the Snake River... Our father worked in a gold mine in Alaska.  He was injured by a falling bucket in the mine December 2nd, 1904 and died the next day.  Because of permafrost the body could not be buried deep and when a tidal wave came years later the graves were washed out and his body was found.

However, atmospheric shock waves generated by the strongest explosions (Pratt 1911) are another possible source mechanism of the tsunamis. Moore et al. (1966) also related the tsunamis observed during the 1965 eruption to shock waves, although the transfer of energy from air to water (or phase-coupling) operates mostly on large areas of deep water (Yokoyama 1987), i.e., larger and deeper than Taal Caldera Lake.

This was later revised to\n32 victims, The eight deaths of victims drowned at Punta Agujereada by the waves 5.5 to 6 meters in height brought the initial tally of people drowned for these two locations to 40. The greatest number of fatalities was said to be from\nthe tsunami, The official death toll for this event was placed at 116. This total must have been earthquake fatalities only, since at Mayagiiez, \"more than 100\"\ndeaths were reported, plus the 4 deaths at Ponce (totaling 104). When added to the tsunami victim count of 40, this would tally 144. In 1997, Mercado Irizarry (personal communication, 1997a) updated the tsunami death toll, with the report October 11, 1918, Puerto Rico of an account by an \"old, very well known gentleman in Aguadilla.\" He said,\n\"deaths should have exceeded 100. The reason was that many persons were unaccounted for and, therefore, not included in the official toll.\" Even more recently, Dillon et al. (1999) reported that 91 people were killed by the tsunami\nin northwestern Puerto Rico. With the significantly higher totals of those who perished from the waves, the total fatalities for the disaster from both the earthquake and tsunami approaches a number greater than 200. (ref #1492)<P>A 1918 M 7.5 earthquake resulted in a tsunami that killed at least 91 people in northwestern Puerto Rico. (ref #1591) <P>This was one of the most violent earthquakes felt on Puerto Rico since its occupation by Europeans. Immediately following the shock a tsunami broke upon the shore, drowning many persons and destroying many native dwellings. Property damage was estimated at about $4 million and 116 lives were lost. (Ref #1128)<P>The October 11, 1918 Mona Passage earthquake triggered a tsunami\nthat affected the western coast of Puerto Rico. The cause of the tsunami was previously suggested to be due seafloor displacement by a normal fault on the eastern wall of the Mona Rift(Mercado and McCann, 1998). We have identified a submarine landslide with steep headwall and sidewalls scarps 15 km off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico using\nnewly available multibeam bathymetry and multichannel seismic reflection profiles. Based on these new data we postulate that the landslide, which was induced by the earthquake, was responsible for the generation of the tsunami. Supporting this idea is the documented rupture of submarine telegraph cables by landslides in the area of our\nmapped landslide during the earthquake (Reid and Taber, 1919). The landslide, which is well marked by fresh and steep scarps, is 9 km wide by 9 km in length in the excavation area, and it has an average thickness of 140-150 m.

Tyrrhenian Sea, Lipari Islands. Tsunami intensity 4, reliability 4. After a period of extraordinary activity of the volcano of Stromboli which started in Feb, its powerful explosion occurred with a noise of unprecedented intensity and with the discharge of enormous puffs of black smoke that enveloped the entire island for a short time. Anyone trying to move was knocked down. The explosion was accompanied by water being blown up from the sea and flooding the coast, everything around was overturned, and all the ships were carried approximately 300m up to vineyards adjacent to the coast. The tsunami waves were generated (evidently, owing to a sudden increase of the atmospheric pressure). \"The displacement of water, like during a weak tsunami, was observed on the Island of Ustica. First, a whirlpool appeared in the sea in the Piccolo Lagoon of the Island of Capri, i.e. in the part of the island facing the Island of Stromboli, and reefs usually covered with water were uncovered for 1 m, and then, 6-7 s later, powerful waves gushed over the normal water line. Oscillations of the sea level of a very low amplitude (0.5 cm) with a period of about 11 min were recorded by the tide gauge stalled at the lighthouse [Faro] near Messina after l8h and lasted 90 min; they resumed half an hour later and lasted 30 min more. The tide gauge in Messina recorded usual sea waves with a period of 7-8 min, but of a low amplitude - about 1 cm, 2 cm maximum - during the eruption. Oscillations of a much higher amplitude started approximately at 18h, and the amplitude reached 7.5 cm 20min later; after that, the waves caused by the eruption started to subside, but continued about 3 hours more. No signs of tsunami in the records of the tide gauges in the towns of Palermo, Catania, Cagliari (Sardinia Is), Naples, on the Island of Ischia, in the town of Civitavecchia were revealed.

One son tried in vain to save the family auto and was swept into a wharf shed where he held onto some beams. The man was washed about 100 m to sea, but managed to get back. His wife was carried about 400 m to sea, but was rescued by two Hawaiians who swam to a still floating canoe to reach her. The man estimated that there were 10 waves. An 18.000-liter water tank was destroyed. At Keauhou the wave height was about 2.4 m and about 0.9 m at Kailua.

For 10 days, the flow poured into the water, sometimes generating local tidal waves. On October 2nd, one family was washed into the water and was almost lost.

(reference #2666)\n<P>1920, February 2, 21:12. Remarks from Report from District Office, Gasmata, 9 February 1920: On the night of Monday last, 2nd instant, at 9:12 pm a very severe earthquake shock passed over Gasmata. It was, according to Commonwealth Meteorological Forms, about strength 8 or 9, and lasted about 1 minute 10 seconds. Everyone rushed from their houses, and the natives were somewhat terrified. The newly re-built jetty was semi-demolished; fissures about 2 inches wide appeared in parts of the Island; many bottles of drugs and medicines in the hospital were broken; the old troops bungalow in the middle of the island has jumped forward off its studs, and broke stringers and cross-pieces. After the quake the harbour water rushed out the main entrance into the sea in a swift torrent but DID NOT RETURN, the result has been that the tides now reach about 20 to 24 inches lower than previous high-water mark. Much dead fish were left stranded on the reefs, and with an unfavourable wind the stench from same is still very strong. On the morning of the 2nd inst., a very heavy swell set in from SSW and continued all day, although no bad weather had happened around here. Whether this had anything to do with the quake I cannot say. The quake seemed to come from that direction, and seemed to pass away towards Talasea. The rumbling and trees knocking in the mountains inland could be heard for minutes afterwards. At Lindenhafen, two of the three houses (European built) collapsed like a pack of cards (which speaks well of the work put in on our bungalow, built by Pte. Burston), and Mr. Ross the Manager, had a narrow escape from injury. \n<P>For 48 hours after the main quake (which did all the damage) tremors of from 30 to 40 seconds duration happened half-hourly, and since then they have happened about six daily. Gasmata island is now joined to Abelle island  previously separated by water.\n<P>The tremors in this District before this time were practically nil, perhaps one or two per year, just faintly perceptible. The natives say that, about 20 years ago, there was a tidal wave, which much damage to life and property.\n<P>(above from reference #99)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 150.0, -6.5 ] } },

There was a very strong earthquake in the southern part of Atacama province, with a zone of destruction approximately from Copiapo to Coquimbo. The instrumental and macroseismic epicenters were fixed at sea in the region of Vallenar - Huasco. This tsunami generating earthquake began with relatively weak, but comparatively rapidly intensifying oscillations, lasting from 1/2 to 8 minutes according to different estimates. The earthquake was preceded by strong foreschocks, felt on the 3rd and 7th of November. Seismic activity in the focal zone of the earthquake was high for two months.\n<P>At Chanaral, the tsunami began an hour after the earthquake and lasted about 4 hours. The sea surged onshore three times. It rose 9 m above the high tide mark, destroyed 14 homes, and carried four homes inland (there was no destruction resulting directly from the earthquake here). The tides were calm, but prolonged.\n<P>At Caldera the sea at first remained completely calm after the earthquake, but then it rose: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 45 minutes after the earthquake, according to different estimates. The most reliable in this respect, is the report of a witness, who at the time of the earthquake was on a ship riding in the harbor, and who set off for the port in a boat immediately after the strong shocks had ceased. When the boat arrived at shore 15 minutes later, the water had risen about 5 m above the high tide level and almost splashed over the moorage.\n<P>At Coquimbo, the sea was absolutely quiet before the earthquake. About 2 hours after the earthquake, a tsunami appeared. The waves spread from the northeast to the southwest along the axis of the bay, passed along the western and eastern shores, but did not cause any damage. On the south shore, the water rose to a considerable height. Three large tidal waves were observed, the third being the most destructive. The water penetrated 2 km at the most low-lying places, and the rise was 5 m above the maximum high tide line or 6 m above the mean sea level. It reached 7 m above mean sea level at the railway quay. The water rose and fell slowly; the ebb was smaller than the flood; the surface of the water was calm.

This tidal wave hit the islands during the same night the steampship was damaged and caused exntensive losses there too (according to the Record of Unusual events at Sea, compiled by an English Steamship Company, and reproduced by the Nautical Branch of the Meteorological Service of England). (reference #415)\n<P>On 19 July 1924 starting at about 19:15 NZMT (possibly Chatham island time CIT (18:30 NZMT)), a series of waves variously said to be 3-6 m high or reaching up to 6 m above HWM, locally called a tidal wave, affected a number of locations on the Chatham Islands over a period of just over three hours. Those locations most affected were the settlements of Wharekauri, Kaingaroa and Owenga on north and eastern side of Chatham Island, and the settlement on Pitt Island. At Kaingaroa, the waves swept over 100 m inland, sweeping away a dam supplying fresh water, one trawler was smashed and another lost. Near Wharekauri, a bridge was badly damaged, fences washed away, and the water washed over Te Awanui island. Several boats were damaged at Owenga, a small hut was washed away and some machinery at the shell-crushing plant damaged. On Pitt Island, the wharf disappeared, two small boats swept up a stream, and beaches eroded of shells. Mangere Island was also affected and a large landslide occurred. There were no deaths or injuries, although one person was washed from his horse near Owenga, and deaths may have been prevented by people at Kaingaroa and Owenga hearing the roaring approach of the first wave and running inland. According to contemporary reports locations on the west coast were not affected. However, recollections written some 70 years later (Holmes, 1993; see transcriptions), which accurately record effects at Wharekauri, also record higher than expected water levels in the creek at Waitangi during the time locations on the east side of the island were affected. However, the account incorrectly attributes the source to South America. \nSeveral accounts also relate the near-capsizing of the ship Tees en route to the Chatham Islands from Christchurch to the tsunami on the Chathams. However the damage to the Tees occurred two days after the tsunami, and was storm related. \nTide charts for Lyttelton on July 19 (held at National Archives, Christchurch) have been checked, but no disturbance is visible on the poor quality records.\nThe newspaper and other reports of this event give a very credible account of a tsunami affecting the Chatham Islands only. The sea level disturbances had a sudden onset with the arrival of the first wave heralded by roaring, effects over eastern and western coasts of the islands within a short time, the occurrence of a series of large waves followed by smaller waves and duration of several hours. The occurrence of a storm is not mentioned, and while the tide was high at the start of the waves and it was a spring tide (both of which are about correct, HW at 1920 CIT, acc. to NIWA Tide Forecaster (www.niwa.co.nz/services/free/tides)), a recollection (Holmes, 1993; see transcriptions) specifically states that the high level at Waitangi, 2 hours after high tide, was odd as the weather was fine at the time.

The waves were noted to be of unusual size, their crests reaching to the deck level, which was 3.3 m above the high water springs mark. The waves were only noted to have damaged the wharf and nothing is noted of their effect on the nearby shore, or anywhere else along the coast.  \nNo source is known for the large waves that damaged the wharf or the exact date on which the waves occurred, so association with distant/offshore meteorological conditions or with a local or distant earthquake is unknown. Locally, it was noted that there was a moderate easterly breeze, which only slightly roughened the sea. A large local earthquake can be excluded, and as the waves seem to have impacted at Tolaga Bay only and there are no events on the NGDC site that are large enough, a distance source can also be excluded. De Lange & Fraser (1999) suggest a similar source to the March and May 1947 tsunamis (q.v.), which de Lange (1997) proposed were caused by marl diapirism. De Lange & Moon (2004) have since proposed a landslide mechanism. However, the 1947 earthquakes have now been shown to exhibit many source and tsunami characteristics associated with tsunami earthquakes (Downes et al., 2001; Doser & Webb, 2003).\nConsidering the possibility that the source of the waves in 1926-28 may be an earthquake, including mildly felt earthquakes like the 1947 events, the Poverty Bay Herald has been searched for a few days following known earthquakes in 1926-27, without finding any accounts of the damage to the wharf. However, the earthquake file is probably incomplete for this era.  Although a day-to-day check of the newspapers is probably warranted, it is problematic that the waves that damaged the Tolaga Bay wharf do not seem to have impacted elsewhere on the coast, noting the March 1947 event was observed along 120 km of coastline and the May 1947 tsunami along 80 km of coastline. Given this, and until such time as more evidence of a tectonically generated tsunami can be found, a few rogue waves or a localised meteo-tsunami seem to be the most probable causes of the waves, although one would expect a longer series of waves in the latter case and greater impact on the nearby shore.\nIn contrast to Fraser (1998), who assigns a reliability of 1 (=certain tsunami) a validity of 2 (questionable, unlikely) following the NGDC classification is assigned." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 178.31, -38.37 ] } },

Both the arrival times and waveforms of the recorded tsunami of the 1927 Lompoc earthquake indicate that it occurred offshore at about 34.2<SUP>o</SUP>N, 120.75<SUP>o</SUP>W, where the water depth is about 1000 m... Using the mechanism solution obtained by them, the seismic moment is estimated to be 3 X 10<SUP>26</SUP> dyne-cm, corresponding to Mw = 7.0. This value is consistent with the surface-wave magnitude, indicating that tsunami excitation is similar to that expected from surface waves. The large tsunami observed at Hilo is due to the bathymetric effects near Hilo Bay. The tsunami magnitude estimate of 7.6 made by Abe (1979) is apparently an overestimate because of this effect. (reference #3796)\n<P>1927, November 4, 5:51. There was a strong earthquake with source on the edge of the shelf on the northern boundary of the Murray - fault zone. Large slides took place on the coast in the Santa Barbara district, and the movement of traffic on the railway was interrupted. Flues were damaged at Lompoc and other coastal settlements. A very strong seaquake was felt on the \"Sokonia\" 50 km (27 miles) from Arguello Point, on the \"Alaska Standard\", 25 km (15 miles) from the same cape and on other vessels.\n<P>A tsunami arose, which was observed on the coast of California and was registered on the Hawaiian Islands. An employee from Surf reported that there was a wave 'approximately 1 1/2 - 2 m (6 feet) high, which began with the crest. A railway employee at Port San Luis observed a fall and rise in water level of 1 1/2 m (5 feet) followed by oscillations in level for an hour. According to the lighthouse attendant, in the same port a rise occurred, followed by a drop of 11/4 m (4 feet), without subsequent substantial oscillations. An observer at Pismo Beach compared the tsunami with large storm waves.\n<P>The tsunami was registered by the tide gauges at Cape Fort (San Francisco), at San Diego and at La Jolla. On the first record, the oscillations began with a slow drop in level at 7:00, with a half period of 24 minutes. Then more rapid oscillations began with a period of about 15 minutes and a maximal amplitude of 4 cm. The sign of the first onset of the tsunami of the record at La Jolla is not definite. The oscillations had a period of 15 minutes, a maximal amplitude of 6 m and lasted about 13 hours.\n<P>At Hilo (Hawaiian Islands), the tsunami began 5.1 hours (at 8:33) after ebb tide, the maximal amplitude of oscillations was 10 cm, the period 12 minutes. At Honolulu, the tide gauge registered weak oscillations with an amplitude of 2 cm and a period of 20 minutes.\n<P>(above from reference #415)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -120.774, 34.813 ] } },

According to a report of the director of the weather bureau in Heracleon, the sea currents had a velocity of about 6 knots.\n<P>The water receded from the coast by approximately 1.5 m as a result of a lowering of the sea level in Nafplio at 14'30m. The reverse flow appeared several minutes later, and the normal level was exceeded by 0.5 m. Then, the water receded again, and the level returned into its usual position. According to accounts, a similar phenomenon took place on the shore of Tolo, 12 km from Nafplio.\n<P>Judging from the onset time of the tsunami in various places, the source of waves more or less coincided with the focus of the main earthquake on April 22 and with its aftershock on April 24, the data on which were given above. But the waves, apparently, began 5 hours after the shock. It can therefore be assumed that they were caused by a powerful underwater landslide.

The earthquake occurred approximately 250 km south of Newfoundland along the southern edge of the Grand Banks. The earthquake triggered a large submarine slump (an estimated volume of 200 cubic km of material was moved on the Laurentian slope) which ruptured 12 transatlantic cables in multiple places, and generated a tsunami... More than 40 local villages in southern Newfoundland were affected, where numerous homes, ships, businesses, livestock and fishing gear were destroyed. Also lost were more than 280,000 pounds of salt cod. Total property losses were estimated at more than $1 million 1929 dollars. (reference #1827)\n<P>A tsunami struck the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland Nov 18, 1929 after the 1702 NST magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred in the Laurentian Slope Seismic Zone. This event is Canada's most tragic earthquake with twenty-eight lives lost. The tsunami swept into the coast of Newfoundland 2.5 hours after the seismic event near the top of a high spring tide. Water levels first fell far below normal then, in three successive waves, that often arrived on shore as breaking waves, water levels rose 2 to 7 m... St. Lawrence at the head of Great St. Lawrence Harbour was one of the communities inundated, fortunately with no loss of life, but with substantial property damage... The map [St. Lawrence] indicates a tsunami height of about 4 m, a runup height of about 13 m and a runup distance of at least 760 m at the head of the harbour... The earthquake shook loose a portion of the continental slope over a 20,000 km2 area and the resulting turbidity current flowed at 70 km/hr to redistribute 200 km3 of material over a 150,000 km2 area on the Sohm Abyssal Plain The tsunami created by the Nov 18, 1929 slump on the Laurentian Continental Slope took about 2 hours to reach Bermuda at an average speed of just over 700 km/hr. It took about 2.5 hours to reach the Burin Peninsula of Newfoundland and about 3 hours to reach Cape Breton Island at an average speed of about 144 km/hr... In the case of the 1929 tsunami as it arrived on the Burin Peninsula, in all cases witnesses report it was first seen at about 1930 NST as a major withdrawal (NST is 0.5 hr ahead of AST used in the rest of Atlantic Canada). In the communities of Lamaline, Taylor's Bay, Lord's Cove and Port au Bras there are reports of a breaking wave arriving; up to three main pulses were seen. Many smaller pulses of the tsunami continued to affect the area for several hours after the main event. In Burin Harbour, which is quite deep, the tsunami tended to be seen as a very rapidly rising sealevel over about a 5 to 10 minute period, then the sealevel rapidly fell over the same period... The tsunami with its three successive pulses arrived during a high astronomic tide. To make matters worse, the three main pulses arrived over about a half-hour period near the top of a rising (extra high) 'spring tide' or during \"the springes\". Fortunately it was a bright moonlit and a windless evening; the sea was dead calm, thus there were no storm waves to do extra damage. In addition, the tsunami's arrival in early evening meant people were up and about and awake to save themselves... Most estimates of the day suggested that the 1929 tsunami elevation was 30 to 50 ft high (9.1 to 15.2 m). In fact, it is doubtful that the tsunami elevation reached more than about 7.5 m above the normal calm sea... (ref #1719)\n<P>The 1929 Newfoundland tsunami the tsunami wave heights were 3 m in St. Lawrence Bay and 7 m in Taylor's Bay, but the runup heights at the heads of the bays were about 13 m.

The waves flooded the land to a height of 2.5 m (8 feet). Homes and cattle were washed away on Awin Island.

Indications show that the water attained a height of 20 to 25 feet at Sapara and swept inland to a depth of approximately two to three hundred yards, washing masses of coral reef ashore and wrecking everything in its path except for full grown coconuts and large isolated trees.\n<P>To the north of Sapara the village of Simbini suffered the most damage - 24 houses being destroyed. At Awar Plantation the wave attained a height of about 12 feet.\n</dd><P>From the Administration Report to Prime Minister's Department, Canberra, 2 January 1931, for effects on Ninigo Group, New Guinea from the event on Dec. 24, 1930:\n<dd><P>At the time of the occurrence, some of the natives of the island of Lau were engaged in cutting copra [on Mal Island]. <B>One child and one man were drowned</B>. The natives employed by a trochus fisher were caught in the wave, but all escaped though some of them were bruised and bumped by the floating debris.\nSome of these men tried to save themselves as they were being washed across the end of the island by catching at the fronds of the coconut palms. As the palms are about 30 to 40 feet in height this will give some idea of the size of the wave. If the waves had occurred at high tide the loss of life and damage to property would have been much greater...\n<P>Practically all the native canoes at the affected places were either broken or damaged and there was a fairly heavy toll of pigs, fowls and dogs. <P>Except for minor instances native gardens were not affected or damaged but all Kapiaks, Betelnut, banana paw-paw and other natural products growing on areas affected by the wave have died from the effects of the salt water...\n<P>Natives report that a similar occurrence happened 40 to 50 years ago and there is no doubt that the knowledge of the previous event minimized casualties, in that when the sea began to recede the majority of the natives ran into the bush...<P>To sum up the position as far as the District of Manus is concerned, is that it has had a very fortunate escape. Had the waves occurred at high tide it seems almost certain that the loss of life, and damage to property would have been very much greater, and must have been in the nature of a calamity.

No significant tsunami was noticeable along the ocean coast near Napier, nor at the Port of Napier, attributed to the outpouring of water from the Ahuriri Lagoon (Callaghan, 1933; Marshall, 1933). Marshall reported that water in the Ahuriri Lagoon (location not given) rose 0.6-0.3 m above normal tide level. However, this may be attributable to differential uplift across the Lagoon, and/or seiching. De Lange & Healy (1986) also found no compelling evidence of a tsunami along the Napier foreshore, despite Laings (1954) report a large wave along Marine Parade and a surge in the inner harbour/Ahururi Lagoon entrance. Considering Callaghan (1933) and Marshall (1933), Laings report must be considered erroneous. Marshalls (1933) report on the coastline from Clifton on the southern shore of Hawke Bay to east of Mohaka, which was examined for evidence of uplift as well as earthquake shaking and tsunami effects, notes very little evidence of tsunami, certainly he mentions no evidence of a large tsunami. The ridges and furrows on the gravel beaches caused by strong shaking were not noted to have been disturbed by waves. Although Marshall (1933) considered at least two of the three large landslides he described from Old Mans Bluff to the Mohaka River capable of causing a localised tsunami, he gives is no indication that any specifically related to the landslides was observed. Other reports indicate a 3 m surge at Wairoa (de Lange & Healy, 1986), a series of surges and recessions (1-2 m?) at Waikokopu (de Lange & Healy, 1986; Marshall, 1933) and several surges at Clifton (1-2 m?) (Parsons, pers. comm.). De Lange & Healy (1986) discuss Harts (1931) evidence that a tsunami was recorded in Sydney, concluding that Harts records must be considered unreliable. <b>A validity of 4 </b>is assigned to the tsunami, for which the generating mechanisms were deformation and/or coastal landslide, and possibly submarine slumping, although none is specifically mentioned." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 176.025, -39.772 ] } },

A tidal wave appeared (in Tuilagi) about 10 minutes after the earthquake on the 4th. At Kira Kira, the rise of water was about 2 m, but since it was ebb tide, the water rose only to the high tide mark, without doing any <B>damage except to one recently built stone moorage</B>, which had already been partly destroyed by the earthquake. \n<P>This wave was observed along the entire northern coast of San Cristobal, being somewhat larger in the eastern part of the shore and gradually diminishing to nothing in the direction to the western tip of the island. \n<P>At Port Mary (Santa Ana Island), the water retreated a very large distance, and then, after a brief pause, rose quickly and reached the highest high tide mark. This cycle of movements, which required about a minute for its completion, recurred three times with diminishing amplitude. According to depth measurements made after the sea had calmed down, the lowest level reached by the water was about 3.5 m below the lowest low tide mark, so that the total rise and fall of water was about 5.5 m.\n<P>Judging by available data, on the south cast of San Cristobal Island, between Cape Surville and Cape Sydney, the water first retreated from shore some distance beyond the lowest low tide mark (it was ebb tide) and then returned and rose, and the water surface became like a wall, which arose at the edge of the reefs.

However, it becomes no clear whether it was a permanent sea level change or the sea returned to its initial position.\n<P>However, in Kos it is still a common belief among the local population and the mass media that a tsunami of 23 m in height affected the coastal zone of Kos city after this earthquake (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch ?v=K7ichtKDzcQ). However, this remains without documentation.\n<P>According to the testimony of an eyewitness, which is cited in the Album of Kos (Manousis1934), in Kos city dark, wild and threatening sea waves run against the coast...\". Such a description could be interpreted as an evidence of tsunami waves affecting the coastal zone. However, in the same publication another eyewitness said that ...the sea was cut through by a strong wind causing huge sea waves running like crazy horses with whirlwind speed...waves ready to attack the land swallowing up everything there. However,it is not clear whether the sea was already rough when the earthquake happened or became rough some time later. This point is better clarified in the account of the eyewitness Kasdaglis (1998) who clearly recollected that after the earthquake his family decided to stay outdoors and while was looking for a safe place to settle they observed that the sea was gloomy, sibylline but not threatening. The same author added that during the evening the calm sea turned to rough. Having in mind that during the same evening heavy rain hit Kos (Manousis 1934; Kasdaglis 1998; various press reports) we concluded that: (1)in the morning of April 23, 1933, when the earthquake struck, the weather was calm, (2)bad weather conditions with strong winds, heavy rain and rough sea prevailed later by the end of the day and during the evening. Combining (1) and (2) we adopted that the <b>sea waves observed very likely were due to strong wind rather than to tsunami triggered by the earthquake.</b>" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 27.299, 36.759 ] } },

This wave followed a very great earthquake off the eastern, or Sanriku, coast of the main Japanese island of Honshu.\nThe earthquake damage was moderate, but the tsunami was devastating. In places the waves rose as high as 75 feet. \nMiyabe investigated the times of arrival of the waves as recorded on mareograms. At such distant points as San Francisco, Honolulu, Iquique, times of arrival check well enough for a wave starting from the earthquake epicenter at\nabout the time calculated as origin time from seismograms (which is good to within a very few seconds). However, the times recorded at Japanese tide stations are in part anomalous; at some of the more distant stations the tsunami was actually recorded as beginning 20 minutes earlier than at the nearest ones. This discrepancy may be due in part to seiches started by the seismic waves in the ground; Miyabe prefers to conclude that the tsunami probably did not originate from a point. In so great an earthquake, which almost certainly involved extensive faulting or block movement, this is to be expected. Omote proposes that there was an earlier wave originating around the margin of an area several hundred kilometers wide and a later wave from a more limited source of the order of 10 kilometers in diameter. An interesting detail was the recording at tide stations in Australia and New Zealand of waves, reflected from the American coast, traveling twice across the Pacific in about 47 hours. \n<P><blockquote>Reference #3909:</i></blockquote> \n<P>In Japan there was a great disaster in Iwate province\nfrom both earthquake and tidal wave, with reported loss\nof 1535 lives, 2000 wounded, 7930 houses, 1570 boats, and\nmillions of dollars of property damage at the ports of\nKamaishi, Miyako, Yamoto and Omoto. \n<center><table>\n<tr><td><br><b><center><h2>Different Reports of Effects</h2></b><hr>\n<Table cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"2\"><tr><td>\n<tr><td valign=\"bottom\"><B>Deaths</B></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><B>Missing</B></td><td align=\"center\"><B>Houses<br>Washed Away</B></td><td align=\"center\"><B>Houses<BR>Destroyed</B></td><td valign=\"bottom\"><B>Reference #</B></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td></td><td>Severe damage</td><td></td><td>79</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"middle\">1,522</td><td>1,542</td><td>4,034</td><td>1,817</td><td>150</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"middle\">3,000</td><td></td><td>6,000</td><td></td><td>414</td></tr>\n<tr><td align=\"middle\">2,986</td><td></td><td>4,086</td><td></td><td>1068</td></tr>\n</table><hr>\n</table>" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 144.622, 39.224 ] } },

The majority of people who were indoors at the time ran outside but some Africans not knowing what was happening rushed indoors.

The earthquake was accompanied by a small tsunami, which was\nobserved at San Estaban. According to reports, the sea first retreated so markedly that the residents rushed to the dry strip of bottom to collect fish. Some of them almost drowned when the reflux was succeeded by a tidal wave.\n<P>Almost immediately during the earthquake (at 12:01), the Manila - Shanghai cable was cut. A ship sent from Shanghai to fix it found breaks at the following points: 17 deg 26 min 24 sec N., 119 deg 16 min 50 sec E., and 17 deg 25 min 45 sec N., 119 deg 16 min 50 sec E. The cable was repaired on February 23-25, but broke again on March 2 about in the middle between these two points, but this time the seismic stations did not register any earthquake. The bottom in the region of the break previously had an average depth of 2,465 m. Measurements of the bottom during repairs showed that the depth of the sea had diminished to 2,366 m 4 km south of the break, and had increased to 2,563 another 2 km further south.\n<P>The distinctive feature of the earthquake was the presence of very intensive long-period (20-30 sec.) waves between P and S onsets on the records of the stations at Hong Kong, Fulyan, Tsi Ka Vei (China) and others.

The lack of evidence for a subaerial source suggests the waves resulted from a submarine landslide. Two small buildings were destroyed, three square km of land were inundated, many trees were uprooted, and 50 barrels of salted salmon washed away.

According to the fishermen, at approximately 6:20, a dull, continuous rumbling was heard on board the ship. It appeared to come from the mountains located beyond the top of the bay. Because of the darkness, one could not make out what was happening. No tremors were felt. It was flood time. The rumbling lasted approximately until 6:50, when the first large wave appeared in the narrowest part of the bay. It was like a steep watery wall, stretching from shore to shore and having a possible height of 30 m. Espying this wave, the fishermen weighed anchor and headed for Cenotaph Island. When the wave reached them 10 minutes later, they were situated 400 m northwest of Cenotaph Island, at a depth of 20 m. No drop in water level or other anomaly preceded the arrival of the wave. The first wave lifted the ship about 15 m above the normal level. To the north and south, beyond the shelter of the island, the wave may even have been another 15 m higher. Immediately after the passage of this wave, the water surface dropped below the normal level. A boat with a net, riding at anchor off Cenotaph Island at a depth of 14 1/2 m touched bottom. The first wave was followed by a second and third at estimated 2 minute intervals, and each successive wave was larger than the preceding one. After each of these waves, the surface of the water again fell below the normal level. Small waves were observed during the half hour after the passage of the third wave. All the waves were directed towards the exit from the bay. After this, floating tree trunks and pieces of ice appeared around the ship. No surge of water was observed. The fishermen in the little house were awakened at about 7:00 by a noise, like the droning of hundred airplanes flying at low altitude, and found that a wave was approaching their house. Taking to a high safe place, they saw three waves pass the island, growing in height, with a speed of about 20 knots.

One particularly high wave completely filled the boat harbour and sunk a launch and cargo lighter and ran inshore for about 150 yards further than any wave has been for more years.

After the second wave, the sea largely receded exposing the land reef. A \"terrific suction noise\" was heard. The withdrawal between the second and the third wave is estimated to have reached one to a few meters in height. Then, the largest wave came and flooded the coast. Seaweed, sea worms and fish are washed up on shore. A bakery, several piers and boat sheds were damaged. The water level reached the base of the stairs of the living quarters of the residents.

At Tova, 1.5 km south of Bwelic in front of the Pouai Pass, the sea level also reached the bases of several house stairs on the shore. A value, more approximate than the one in Bwelic (since the local geodetic reference point was not found) of 2.2 m above the highest tides was estimated (equivalent + 3.2 m).

Validity likely (3). There was an eruption of the Raluan and Tawurwur Volcanoes in Blanche Bay. The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.\n<P>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20.\n<P>At about 14:00, the water in Rabaul Harbor quietly retreated 90 m from shore and then returned to its usual boundary. On Raluan Is, the water also retreated slowly, then flooded the shore to 140 m beyond the high high tideline, after which it returned to its usual mark, leaving many fish on shore. In Keravia Bay, at about 13:30, the water flooded a road, rising 1 1/2-2 m above the usual level.\n<P>On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul.\n<P>Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed.\n<P>At 11:00, it was noticed that the reef south of Matupi Is had become exposed. This had never happened before.\n<P>At 13:10 the water off the west coast of Raluan Is became turbid and rough. At about the same time, the reef here dried up; the reef was hidden under water at 13:15, but it came to the surface again at 13:20. During the day, many residents collected fish on the reefs, and about 20 of these people died during the eruption.\n<P>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows. The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick...\n<P>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.\n<P>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of the waves was 2-2.5 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th. \n<P>During the eruption, <B>more than 500 people perished, including those who drowned</B>. \n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #1412:</i></blockquote> \n<P>1937, May 29.

An earthquake on December 26, 1939 in Turkey between Erzincan and Erzurum caused a small tsunami in the Black Sea.

The wave action slowly diminished until the sea returned to its normal state. A small tsunami reached the Black Sea coast of the [former] USSR and was recorded by tide gauges.

Tsunami on the East Coast of India and Tsunami in the Andaman Sea, 5000 deaths?. (reference #96)\n<P>1941, June 26. Andaman earthquake had a moment magnitude Mw 7.7 and was located at 12.1 N and 92.5 E (Bilham et al., 2005). A tsunami was triggered by this earthquake in the Bay of Bengal. Height of the tsunami was reported to be of the order of 0.75 to 1.25 meters. At the time no tidal gauge was in operation. Mathematical calculations suggest that the height could be of the order of l m. This tsunami was witnessed along the eastern coast of India. It is believed that nearly 5,000 people were killed by the tsunami on the east coast of India. Local newspapers are believed to have mistaken the deaths and damage to a storm surge, however, a search of  meteorological records does not show any storm surge on that day on the Coromandel Coast (Murty, 1984). National dailies like the Times of India, which reported the quake's shaking effects, did not mention any deaths, either as a result of a storm surge or a tsunami. (reference #2771)\n<P>The most recent of the major earthquakes in the Andaman\nIslands preceding the 2004 rupture occurred in 1941, a year before Japanese occupation of the islands. The earthquake\nwas described only after the Second World War Ghingran,\n1953; Krishnan, 1953). Although the tsunami generated by\nthe 1941 earthquake is stated to have caused much loss of life along the east coast of India (Murty and Rafiq, 1991), no official (or unofficial) account of the impact of the remote tsunami has been discovered. Jhingran describes the loss of low-lying western-facing forest cover on the Andamans, presumably by a tsunami, but mentions no loss of life. Eyewitness reports published informally by the Society of Andaman and Nicobar Ecology (SANE) following the 2004 earthquake add further details to the official 1941 accounts. The central watchtower of the cellular jail in Port Blair collapsed along with a hospital and other masonry structures. Eyewitnesses spoke of subsidence of Ross Island (as in the recent earthquake), requiring its abandonment in favor of the current mainland capital, Port Blair. (reference #8835)\n<P>The small tsunami results from a combination of that mechanism and of a source located under the islands themselves and in shallow water, implying a reduction in amplitude under Greens law when transitioning to a deeper basin[...]Murty and Rafiq (1991) suggested that it resulted in 5000 deaths in India. However, Ortiz and Bilham (2003) and Bilham et al. (2005) have failed to unravel any scientific or press evidence to support this assertion (in contrast, e.g., to the Car Nicobar event of 1881), casting strong doubt on its veracity: it is extremely unlikely that a 1m tsunami would result in such a death toll.

Although accounts conflict to some extent, it appears that the largest tsunami wave did not arrive at Pasni until several hours following the mainshock. There are many possible explanations for this delay, the most likely of which is that it was <B>caused by one or more submarine landslides triggered by the earthquake</B>. (ref #8275)\n<P>The total number of casualties due to the tsunami is difficult to assess given the lack of precise reports and the impossibility to separate victims of the earthquake and of the waves. It could be as high as several thousand, but is given conservatively as 300 by AMBRASEYS and MELVILLE (1982)(ref #1117). A most remarkable aspect of the 1945 tsunami is that its main waves were significantly delayed (average 2.5 h) with respect to the earthquake.

The depth of the water to the north of the spit increased from 1.5 to 30 m. Apparently, the wave resulting from this slide reached the lighthouse situated to the east on Sisters Rock. Acoording to the lighthouse attendant, a wave 2-2.5 m high rolled onto the little island 7 minutes after the earthquake; a second wave 0.25-0.5 m high moved in at a distance of 30 m from the first; the velocity of the waves was 10 knots.\n<P>A section of coast with a pier on Goose Spit which cuts off the entrance to Comox Harbor, subsided more than 0.5 m.

The number of homes destroyed directly by the earthquake was 2,598; 1,443 people died. In addition, 1,451 homes were washed away by the ensuing tsunami waves.<P>A sizeable tsunami rolled onto the coast of the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku Island. The tsunami was strongest on the east coast of Kii Strait, from Fukuro to Mio, where the rise of water was 6 m. The rise was slightly less on the western coast of the strait, and increased from south to north (from 2-3 to 4.5-5 m). In Tosa Bay, the maximal rise\nof water was observed in the Susaki region, where it also reached 5 m, but the impact of the tsunami was considerably weaker here than in the Kii Strait.<P>According to visual observations, the first wave was the highest at Sinjo and Kanno'ura, while the second wave was the highest at most other points, and the third was highest far into Susaki Gulf. The records for the tide gauges situated on the eastern shore of the Kii Strait, showed that the tsunami began here with an ebb, which was followed by a large rise in the water level.<P>The following is known about the effects of the tsunami at individual points. On both shores of the entrance to Yura Bay (at Katakui, Okui, Kashiwa and west of Kamiya), the rise of water was 2.7-2.8 m. According to residents, the tsunami advanced slowly here, and the water rose gradually; at Katakui, the sea bottom was exposed. East of the Kashiwa-Itoya line, the rise of water increased markedly, reaching 3.9 m at Yura and Fukui, and 4-4.2 m at the head of the bay.<P>At Tokushima, the water rose only 1.5 m and the incursion did no damage. The rise of water increased towards the head of Akaishi Bay, which constricts in a southwestern direction. At Komatsushima, it was only 1.7-1.9 m (possibly due to the protection of the breakwater) and at Yokosu, the water did not cross a dike 2 m high, but between Kanaiso and Akaishi, it even flowed across a dike 3 m high. At Akaishi, the water rose 2.8-2.9 m. The tsunami approached Akaishi in the form of a step, and the run-up was rather strong. No little damage was done: dikes were destroyed, homes were flooded, and different objects were carried away.<P>At Shishikui, partly screened from the south by a rocky cape, the rise of water on shore was 3.3 m. Protective tree stands, planted along the coast, somewhat weakened the thrust of the water, and for the most part it overflowed along the mouth of the Shishikui River. The broken surf rose up river. On the south side of this cape, the rise of water was 4.4 m. At Kanno'ura, situated somewhat to the west, the rise of water was rather high, but the coast did not suffer, except for the top of a little bay which constricts to the north. The ships in the harbor did not run aground which indicates the low speed of currents at the steep and deep shore.<P>At Kanno'ura and at Cape Muroto, according to accounts, the movement of the water began with an ebb tide. Muroto Port dried up as far as the breakwater. At Cape Muroto, both the rise of water and the wave periods were less than on other sections of the coast. At Kochi, a large area of the subsided shore was flooded with water, but the tsunami itself was very weak. The tsunami practically did not enter Urado Bay which has a narrow, long and very shallow entrance.<P>The tsunami was registered far from the source, on the coast of the Hawaiian Islands and North and South America.<P><I>See individual runup locations for more information.</i>.\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #150:</i></blockquote> \n<P>Lists 1,362 deaths, 11,661 houses destroyed, 1,451 houses washed away, 2,598 houses burned down.\n<P>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Honshu1946\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 135.6, 33.0 ] } },

The largest rise in the water level was observed about 15 km north of Gisborne on the low-lying shore between Whangara and Tatapuri. Eyewitness reports agreed that the second wave was the largest, for it reached a height of 9-10 m. Houses, roads and fields were damaged, although only a short distance of the shore was flooded. it is possible that the tsunami resulted from a landslide.

It was mildly felt in several places (maximum\nintensity MM4) along-the east coast, including Gisborne and Tolaga Bay. Half an hour after the earthquake a tsunami hit the coast, the tsunami being observed or its effect observable over a distance of, at least 115 km. It is possible that a small wave reached the Chatham Islands, over 600 km to the southeast. Fortunately, the coast along which the tsunami reached damaging heights was sparsely populated in 1947. Its greatest reported runup height of about 10m occurred at Tatapouri Point, and along the beach north of Turihaua Point, where it demolished a small beachside house, and carried away the decking and\nsuperstructure of a 16m span wooden bridge across the Pouawa River, depositing it about 800m upstream. Houses at Tatapouri and Mahanga were also structurally damaged, and water entered others at Makorori, Wainui Beach, and Kaiti Beach. Along the beach south of Mahanga, north and south of Young Nick's Head, at Makorori, Tatapouri and Pouawa, crops\nand/or fences were damaged. At Gisborne, three large bores and a number of smaller waves surged into the harbour and up the Turanganui River and its tributaries, but the water did not overtop the wharves nor did it do any damage along the river banks. Bores were also reported in other rivers between Young Nick's Head and Tolaga Bay. Two old bridges on the old coast road at Waihau Beach were swept away. Fish were reported washed ashore at Tatapouri and in large quantities, along the beach between Mahanga and Mahia.\n<P>The tsunami occurred less than half an hour before high tide (at Gisborne) and hence its effects were at near maximum. Several people observed the arrival of the first wave and none noted any effect that might suggest that the water retreated prior to the first large wave arriving. Hence the tsunami arrived with a leading elevation, or if there was a depression, it was minor.\n<P>According to one observer, the retreat of the first wave reduced the impact of the second, but the second wave appeared to be larger when it formed out to sea. At Tatapouri and Turihaua Point, the first two waves were reported as about 3-4 minutes apart, the water remaining at a high level for about ten minutes after the second wave. Gisborne harbour experienced three large surges, followed by smaller surges every 8-10 minutes for about two hours.\n<P>Although various accounts of the tsunami suggest arrival times ranging from 8 to 50 minutes after the earthquake, other accounts more reliably indicate arrival times at Pouawa, Gisborne and Mahia, of no less than about 25 minutes.

The waves struck the Hawaiian Islands at 1:00 pm. Property damage from these waves in the Hawaiian Islands was estimated at $800,000 to $1,000,000; however no lives were lost. It also caused damage on the west coast of the United States and was observed on tide gauges throughout the Pacific Basin.\n<P>Reference #79 lists considerable damage and considerable loss of life in the Kuril Islands.\n<P>The waves of the tsunami of 4-5 November 1952 were noted from Iturup l. on the south (height of wave 2.5 m.) to the village of Shubertovo near Ust'-Kamchatsk (wave height 0.5-1 m.) and had destructive force over an extent of more than 700 km. of the Pacific coast -- from Onekotan l. on the south to the Kronotsky Peninsula (Kamchatka) on the north. The morphology of the shores and the relief of the bottoms of bays and straits played an important role in the heightening of the waves upon their arrival at the coast; waves which were imperceptible to ships on the open ocean, at the coast transformed themselves into terrible battering rams, which not only destroyed installations but changed the coastal relief, washing away sandy soils and causing landslides... The greatest destruction and suffering of 4-5 November were caused by the tsunami which arose as a result of the earthquake and which took in about 700 km of the east coasts of Kamchatka and the Kuril Is. On the average the height of the waves on the coast reached 6-7 m. In Kamchatka and on the Kuril Is. destructive sea waves appeared 30-40 minutes after the earthquake. At most points the beginning phase of the waves was accompanied by a lowering of the level of the ocean. Hence it follows that\nthe actual moment of appearance of the waves on the coast occurred half a period earlier. (reference #4252)\n<P>Kurilske was about 15 thousand inhabitants, about 4 thousand perished, extensive destruction... (reference #9224)\n<P> Because of the absence of casualties in the far field, this event was often perceived as involving a deceptive\ntsunami, as no reports were available from the near field. The 1952 Kamchatka tsunami was, in fact, a closely\nguarded state secret in the then-USSR, especially since we now know that it had eradicated the sensitive naval\nbase at Severo-Kurilsk. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, information started to slowly trickle out\nin the form either of dissemination abroad of existing reports or of studies resulting from new research into this matter. Among the latter, Smyshlyaev (reference #11472) reported 7,802 civilian deaths in the Northern Kurils, and estimated that the total death toll in the city of Severo-Kurilsk, including military casualties, must have reached 10,000 and perhaps as high as 17,000, making the event by far the deadliest tsunami in the twentieth century. (reference #9223)\n<P>). Present day estimates based on the existed  data on population density in the area and available damage reports from some selected coastal locations show that  minimum number of victims was about 4000 people with estimated maximum as high as 14000 fatalities (Smyshlyaev, 2003). Based on this, the most realistic estimate for the fatality level can be adopted as 10,000 people, the majority of which (more than 99%) were killed by tsunami. (reference #11763)\n<P>The source of 1952 earthquake was located in two time zones. According to Greenwich (UTC), the earthquake happened on November 4 at 16 hours 58 minutes. In Kamchatka (+12 hours) at this time was November 5, 4-58 am, and in Kuril Islands, which live in Sakhalin time (+11 hours) was 3-58 am. So, local people from Severo-Kurilsk use the time 4 am for the earthquake (reference #12048)\n<P>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Kam1952\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 160.057, 52.755 ] } },

The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt , but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape\nOmae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <U>+</u> km.

After the earthquake, variations in the water level of up to 100 m (300 feet) were determined by echo sounding. It is\npossible that turbidity currents played a part in generating the wave, since underwater cables in the area of the epicenter were displaced, broken and buried under loose alluvium.

Canberra, Friday.--An earthquake described by U.S. seismologists as a \"rip - snorter\" occurred near Rabaul today, but no casualties resulted. Houses, tanks and power lines were damaged. There was no panic... Landslides brought trees to earth, smashing light and power lines and blocking roads. The epicentre of the upheaval was estimated within 30 miles and New Britain is still feeling reaction to a settling down somewhere under the sea. Water was sucked from Simpson Harbour, in which Rabaul nestles. It went and came back several times before the level became normal. An hour after the first shock at 2:30 a.m., water rose to an unusual height at Kokopo, beyond Blanche Bay, but quickly subsided.... It caused a tidal wave alert in Hawaii, but the warning was later cancelled. Another tremor shook Rabaul Town at 10 a.m." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 152.868, -4.449 ] } },

There was a multiple eruption of the Miyejin submarine volcano (31 deg 56.7 min N., 140 deg 0.5 min E.) 130 km south of Hachijo Island. The augite-hypersthene-dacite composition of the lavas determined the explosive nature of the eruptions. All the explosions were well recorded by the hydrophones of the American SOFAR system, including those on the coast of California. Some of the eruptions were observed visually from ships and airplanes by Japanese specialists. Thus, during the weak eruption of September 23 at 13h 40m, a water dome, with protuberances 600-800 m high and 2 km in diameter, arose over the volcano. No seaquake was felt, but waves 50 m long and 2 m high spread over the sea surface. During the stronger eruptions weak tsunamis were generated, 52 of which were registered by the tide gauge on Hachijo Island. The strongest of these waves were also registered by tide gauges on Jogashima Island and Cape\nOmae on the south coast of Japan. The travel time of the waves to Hachijo Island was about 30 minutes, the period 1.5 minutes, the height 10-90 cm. In the nature of dispersion and other parameters, the waves corresponded to theoretical Cauchy-Poisson waves from an initial impulse with a source diameter of 2 <U>+</u> km. Some waves were like pulses. This was apparently due to the interference of waves bending around both sides of Aoga-shima Island, midway between the volcano and Hachijo Island. \n<P>The tsunami of September 26 was recorded in Hilo, in the Hawailan Islands with an amplitude of less than 0.1 m. \n<P>The ship \"Kiyo Maru No 5\" of the Japanese hydrographic service, which had come out to study the eruption, was lost in the eruption of September 24." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 139.85, 32.1 ] } },

A drop in the wind allowed the wave to roll back across the lake, reversing the path of the squall.\" Lockridge et al.

The main shock was followed 13 later by an aftershock of Ms=7.2 located about 5 km ENE of Santorini (Perissoratis, r468).\nThis earthquake activity was associated with a very large tsunami 25 m heigh, observed in the southern coasts of Amorgos, and which affected all other central and southern Aegean islands and the northern coasts of Crete, where its heigh was 1-2 m (Perissoratis, r468). The tsunami source was located in the deepest patt of the Strait of Amorgos (Soloviev, r643).\nThe severity of the waves of July 9, 1956, was not uniform. It varied greatly from place to place and over rather short distances. Waves up to 15 m in height were observed and many casualties were reported.

The epicenter was located on the northern coast of Cross Sound near Palma Bay.  Underwater cables were broken in Juneau, Skagway, and Wrangell.  A local submarine slump off Khantaak Island in Yakutat Bay caused <B>3 deaths</B> and wrecked a boat.  Lituya Bay, the site of repeated huge local tsunamis, experienced a massive landslide which generated a surge of water reaching 525 meters in height -- 400 feet higher than the Empire State Building.  2 boats were wrecked, and <B>2 deaths</B> resulted.  30 million cubic meters of soil and loose material were washed away, along with ten square km of forest.  Shellfish colonies, a cabin, and mining equipment were also destroyed by this massive surge.  Total property damage --primarily from the three lost boats -- exceeded $100,000 (Reference #239).\n<P>The earthquake caused numerous rock avalanches and slides. In Disenchantment Bay, a \"chunk\" weighing several tons broke off from a glacier descending to the water; waves 6 m high arose on the surface of the bay. On Khantaak Island, the sea waves resulting from a coastal section submerging under water reached a height of 5-6 m. A collapse in the mouth of the Alsek River caused a wave 1-2 m high, which spread upriver. The water level in the lower reaches dropped approximately 1 m; several hours later, the dam was breached and the shores of the river were flooded. In Glacier Bay, rocks crashed down from the steep beaches, resulting in small waves no more than 1/2-1 m (2-3 feet) high. Similar waves were observed in Dixon Harbor several minutes after the earthquake. The most catastrophic events, unique in the history of strong earthquakes, occurred in Lituya Bay, which is the T-shaped bed of an ancient glacier that has been filled in with water. The distinctive feature of the bay is the strong tidal currents at the throat, reaching 12 knots in velocity. At the time of the earthquake, about 300 million square meters of rock collapsed into Gilbert Bay from the northeast shore. The water extruded from the bay by the collapsing mass, splashed up on the opposite shore, reaching a colossal height. The movement of the water was so fast, that it uprooted a whole forest in the flood zone and stripped the bark and branches from the trees. Besides this gigantic splash, the collapse of this huge mass gave rise to a wave, which crossed the entire Lituya Bay from Gilbert Bay to the sea with a velocity of 150-200 km/hr, that is, with the speed of gravity waves, and devastated the shores of Lituya Bay. The tectonic dislocations in the source of the earthquake, and possibly the wave emerging from Lituya Bay, gave rise to a small tsunami, which was registered on remote tide gauges (Reference #415).\n<P>The main mass of the slide, as outlined on figure 16, is a prism of rock that is roughly triangular in cross section, with dimensions of 2,400 feet and 3,000 foot along tho slope, a maximum thickness of about 300 feet normal to the slope, and a center of gravity at about 2,000 foot altitude. From those dimensions and an assumed specific gravity of 2.7, the volume and weight of tho rock mass are, respectively, <B>40 million cubic yards and 90 million tons</B>.

The wave coincided with an unusually high tide. In Prince Rupert a high tide of 7.5 m occurred at 03:18 (LT). This was 0.52 m above the predicted tide, and only 0.34 m below the all time recorded extreme high tide.<P>At Wiah Point the wave, or waves, washed over a high water rock, and dislodged two big oil tanks which has been erected there about 30 cm above high water, and washed them onto the shore. The tidal wave that hit the remote west coast of the Queen Charlotte I., got 10.7 m, tore oil tanks from concrete bases and apparently took the life of a man. The tidal wave caused extensive damage at Weah Point near the village of Masset.<P>About 3.2 km north of Masset a number of logs were washed onto the road, which is there about 1.2 m above high water. At Tow Hill logs were moved that had been in the same position on the beach for a number of years. At the mouth of the Tlell River, where a tidal bore has been observed on occasion, noise as of a wave travelling up the river was heard during the night, and a small piece of arable land near the high water line was flooded and damaged.<P>No record of the tsunami wave is seen on the tide gauge records in Prince Rupert or in Tusu, on the west coast of the Queen Charlotte I. A check for a filed death certificate at the Dept. of Vital Statistics in Victoria reveals a man was indeed lost in the sea in the period March 28-30, 1963 but reported missing near Jedway, BC which is on the inside southern tip of Moresby I. just north of Cape St. James.<P>An interview with Mr. Edward Hartt of the Canadian Coast Guard at Seal Cove near Prince Rupert confirmed the early morning arrival of this approximately 5.5 m high wave (over the tide) at Langara Lighthouse where he was the lightkeeper at the time. The wave broke two large fuel tanks from their moorings at the lighthouse dock and deposited them ashore well above high water. Mr. Hartt felt the source of this large wave was probably from the southwest because of the areas where most the damage occurred around the lighthouse.<P>A disturbance was reported from Dixon Entrance region of the Queen Charlotte I. during the night of March 30-31. The wave heights reached from 3.7 to 5.5 m above high water and caused minor damage at Langara I., Wiah Point, and Port Simpson. The disturbance was not recorded by any tide gauge and was not reported from any other area. No correlation between this event and any seismic or atmospheric disturbance has been found.<P>The date reported by von Hake and Cloud [1965] is different to that reported in the Canadian newspapers but likely represents the same event. The report of minor damage at Port Simpson by VonHake and Cloud was not confirmed in the interviews of Port Simpson residents by the author. It is unfortunate that the lightkeepers records from other lighthouses nearer to Port Simpson during this period (March 1963) are no longer available to confirm any closer sightings of this unusual wave to Port Simpson. According to Mr. Ed. Hartt these records were destroyed when the coast Guard moved their offices from Prince Rupert to Seal Cove in 1972...<P>Stephenson [2003] resumes the information on this event as follows:<br>-If there was a tsunami, it was a local event generated by an underwater slump.<br>-This tsunami event was almost certainly smaller than any of the \"reported\" heights. From the report by Willie Rapatz it follows that the dislodged tanks were only about 0.3 m above the high water (HW) line, and the road which logs washed up onto was only about 1.2 m above the HW line.<br>-The reported 10 and 12 m waves were probably heights above chart datum, meaning that the maximum wave height was about 5.5 m.<P>(above from reference #4153)<P>1963, March 30/31.

The 2.6x10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>3</sup> slide mass flung down 30 million cubic meters of water to flood the Piave Valley below. \n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #10992:</i></blockquote> \n<P>1963, October 9. The Vajont Landslide occurred at 10.39 pm in Italy, in the Dolomites of Friuli, on the borders of the Veneto Region and about 100 km north of Venice. A mass of approximately 270-300 million m<sup>3</sup> of rock and debris collapsed into the reservoir generating a wave that over-topped the 261.6 m high double curved arch dam built across a V-shaped gorge. The flood wave dropped into the Piave Valley destroying the town of Longarone and other villages nearby. <b>More than 2,000 people (the real number is not known) were killed</b>.\n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #10993:</i></blockquote> \n<P>1963, October 9. At 22:39 a huge landslide of about 270 million m<sup>3</sup> slid from Mount Toc into the Vajont artificial reservoir, in north-eastern Italy. The amount of water in the basin at that moment was about 115 million m<sup>3</sup>. The resulting displacement of water caused the generation of an impulse wave that spread throughout the basin. Its impressive wave run-up on the north slope of the lake, in front of Mount Toc, reached and <b>damaged buildings located in Casso</b> about 235 m over the original height of the lake surface. The resulting wave rundown crashed into the front of the landslide and partially crossed over the slide bulk, reaching the depressions behind the slide. On the east side of the basin, a portion of the water which was pushed forward by the landslide formed a wave with smaller amplitude that travelled to the east, reaching the eastern most end of the reservoir in the mountains. \n<P>During the whole event several impulse waves crested the dam or moved onto the surrounding slopes which became a way for the water to move out into the narrow canyon that connects the dam to the Piave Valley. The mass of water that poured into the canyon, compressing the air, generated a wave of pressure that acted as a wind. This \"wind\", propagating at a speed greater than the waterfront, preceded the waterfront and produced the first damage in Longarone, before the water reached the town. The villages located along the Piave riverbed were completely devastated and turned into a flat plain of mud, with about 1700 casualties. The wave travelled upstream for about 5 km and in the downstream cross-sections of Ponte nelle Alpi and Belluno (located respectively at about 11 and 19 km from Longarone) the estimated maximum flow was 20% - 50% higher than the one observed during the famous 1966 flood wave. \n<P>The water depth of the wave in some points exceeded 50 m.  \n<P><blockquote><i>Reference #10995:</i></blockquote> \n<P>1963, October 9.

Newspaper and other reports suggesting 3,000-5,000 deaths are very unreliable. (reference #9675)\n<P>A moderately violent phreatomagmatic explosive eruption of Taal Volcano, in the Philippines, occurred from 28 to 30 September 1965. The main phreatic explosions, which were preceded by ejection of basaltic spatter, opened a new crater 1.5 kilometers long and 0.3 kilometer wide on the southwest side of Volcano Island in Lake Taal. The eruption covered an area of about 60 square kilometers with a blanket of ash more than 25 centimeters thick and killed approximately 190 persons. ..\n<P>The explosions within the crater area produced shock waves that generated water waves, which probably reached\nmaximum height between Volcano Island and the west shore of Lake Taal. These waves capsized some of the boats filled with the fleeing residents of the island and accounted for many of the fatalities. The maximum height of the waves is not known, because evidence of wave height during the early, most violent phase of the eruption is now covered by layers of ash. However, on the west shore of Lake Taal, directly west of the mouth of the explosion crater, there is clear evidence that waves reached 4.7 meters above lake\nlevel and swept inshore as much as 80 meters. The debris left by these waves is on top of the air-fall ash, hence the waves must have occurred very late in the eruption. Undoubtedly much larger waves swept that coast earlier. \n<P>A streamflow gage 1.5 kilometers downstream from the outlet of Lake Taal shows an increase of flow from an average of 20,500 liters per second for several days before the eruption to a maximum of 28,400 liters per second on 28 September, followed by decreases to 23,800 liters per second\non 29 September, and 22,800 liters per second on 30 September. Such an increase is probably due to excessive\nwave action and to seiches produced by the explosion shock waves, as well as to displacement of water by the ash fall and to the inordinately heavy rain that accompanied the eruption.\n<P>(above from reference #5094)\n<P>Many of the 190355 fatalities occurred when tsunami waves capsized boats containing residents fleeing from Taal Island to the western shore of the lake (near Agoncillo).

It reached the nearest coasts of the islands of Shikoku and Kyusllu approximately 20 minutes after the earthquake. On the average, the range of the oscillations in sea level on these coasts was 2-2.5 m. The greatest rise of water, 3 m\nor somewhat more, was resgistered on Shikoku Island at \nUrashiri and Komame; here the water flooded across the protective dikes and caused destruction. At most points, however, the oscillations in level did not exceed the regular flood and ebb oscillations. The tsunami, on the basis of visual observations, began with a flood tide almost everywhere. The first or the second wave was the highest. As a rule, the water level rose quietly, and strong currents arose only in narrow straits. The mean period of oscillations was close to 20 minutes.\n<P>The tsunami was registered clearly by the tide gauges on the southern coast of Japan. The tsunami begins with a flood tide on all the tide gauge records. However, on the records of the instruments set up on Shikoku Island, the height of the first trough is approximately twice as great as the height of the first crest. For this reason, it has been surmised that there were subsidences of the floor in the southern part of the source of the tsunami, while elevations of the floor predominated on the whole at the source. According to Hatori, the vertical displacements of the sea bottom at the source of the tsunami were about 20 cm, and the energy of the tsunami was 1.3 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. According to Aida, a comparatively uniform elevation of the bottom by 30-35 cm took place at the source, and the energy of the tsunami was (1.4-2.2) X 10<sup>19</sup> ergs.

The tsunami also reached a height of 5 m in places on the Sanriku coast.\n<P>The tsunami was observed by tide gauges in Japan and throughout the Pacific Basin in Mexico, Russia, the Marshall Islands, Alaska, California, and Hawaii. \n<P>As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, 52 people died and 329 people were injured; 676 homes were completely destroyed and 2,994 homes were half destroyed; 13 homes burned down and 529 homes were flooded; 97 ships were washed away and 30 were sunk. In addition, roads, bridges and protective dikes were destroyed. The total damage was estimated at least at 130 million dollars. \n<P>The mean displacement of the surface of the sea at the source has been estimated by Abe at +82 cm in the zone of elevations, and -20 cm in the the zone of subsidences. Aida estimated the maximal initial rise of water at 5 m, the drop at 2 m, and the energy of the tsunami at 4 X 10<sup>20</sup> ergs. The maximum radiation of the tsunami, according to his calculations, was directed along the minor axis of the source, while more long-period oscillations radiated out along the major axis. \n<P>View a calculated <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/tsu_travel_time.shtml#Honshu1968\">tsunami-travel-time map</a>." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 143.2, 40.8 ] } },

Resulting downslope movement of a large volume of sediment in the vicinity of the Kitimat delta caused substantial demage to nearby dock facilities and coastal settlements.\n<P>On January 1975, construction was completed on a 7.5 m-high rock fill crib wharf built outward from the beach at Moon Bay. On April 1975, construction of a rock fill and dredged sand breakwater was initiated using coarse dredge material excavated from the bottom within and slightly seaward of the tidal zone. On the morning of April 27, 1975, the breakwater and crib wharf were seen to move seaward, being carried by the initial movement of the sediment slide, approximately 53 minutes after extreme low\ntide (6.02 m drawdown from high tide).

In Laucala Bay waters the amplitude, measured from crest to trough, may have been about 0.5 m (i.e. the order of half the tidal range) because sand banks appeared and disappeared and the change in level on the barrier reef was sufficient to have a noticeable effect on appearance of the ocean waves breaking on the reef edge, according to reliable observers at the MRD office which is about 2 km from Laucala Bay shoreline and 8 km from the reef bounding the seaward side of the bay (Fig. 3). Unfortunately the only available tide-gauge data in Suva are smoothed 15-minute mean plots and mean hourly values of the Suva Harbour sea level. These data 'effectively smooth out the tsunami waves and a tsunami in Suva Harbour could not be detected. The occurrence of the waves is of particular interest because earthquakes with such a small magnitude do not generally cause tsunamis (Iida, 1970). The tsunami was probably generated by a minor submarine slump caused by the shaking (intensity MM 4-5) in the Suva-Beqa outer reef zone in a manner similar to that of the 1953 tsunami (Everingham, 1983b), which illustrates .the ease with which a slump can be initiated. If slumping can be started by relatively low earthquake intensities even a minor shallow tremor in the southeastern Viti Levu seismic zone (Fig. 4) could start a submarine slump should the epicentre be close to a suitable source.

A catastrophic earthquake shook Sumbawa Island. It covered an extensive area from the southern coast of Indonesia to the northwestern coast of Australia. A large tsunami was produced. The first press reports announced waves 30 m high in Indonesia and 8 m high in Australia Apparently, these figures were exaggerated. A group from the International Tsunami Information Center\nvisited the coastal regions of Sumba, Sumbawa, Lombok and Bali Islands to assess the destruction and wave run-ups, and to obtain other detailed information from local people. Inaccessible areas on the southern coast of Sumba and\nSumbawa islands were photographed from the air. Information was processed that had been gathered by the Indonesian military, search and rescue parties, provincial administration, and by medical teams visiting accessible areas in the coastal villages to offer help and assess the extent of loss of property and life. These records were supplemented by radio broadcast accounts from individual\nsettlements. <P>The southern coasts of the islands, with the exception of Bali, is sparsely populated. Villages are generally small and scattered. Hence the loss of human life was not high. According to incomplete data, over 180 people were killed and 3,900 were left homeless. Fishing boats and equipment were lost. For a large part of the Indonesian territory, which had sustained heavy damage from the tsunami, no information is available on the height of the rise in the water level. However, in the accessible region of Sumbawa Island, preliminary information reported that the tsunami reached a height of at least 15 m above the\nhigh-tide mark and inundated the island up to 500 m inland.\n<P>According to eyewitness accounts, the tsunamis appeared on the Indonesian coast about an hour or two after high tide, beginning with an ebb, which soon left a 100-200 m wide drained belt. This was followed by three large waves with a period of about 5 min or less. The first wave was the\nhighest and most ferocious. Several witnesses noted the duration of agitation of the sea although most made no mention of it. An unusual phenomenon occurred during the time interval between the earthquake and the arrival of the tsunami. Residents of villages in the Sumbawa and Lombok Islands thrice heard a sound at intervals estimated from a few seconds to 1 min and more. It was diversely described as sounding like a bomb explosion or a sonic boom. The sound\nreportedly emanated from the epicentral area. Nearly every village reported that the water became black and some reported a rise in temperature and an unpleasant smell. The tsunami reached a height of more than 10 m along the coast of Sumbawa. The main destruction was observed on the Sumbawa and Lombok islands.<P>The tsunami was also observed on the northern and western coasts of Australia. It was reported that on-the Australian coast, as on the Indonesian coast, three waves appeared, the first being the largest. Agitation of the sea continued for several hours. In Dampier the wave reached a height of 2 m; in Port Sampson it varied from 2 to 4 m; in Cape Leveque it reached 6 m. The arrival of the tsunami coincided with an observable ebb and a low tide in many places. These factors weakened the overall effect of the tsunami. Evidently, no lives were lost in Australia although there was one report of a person drawn into the sea by waves.<P>(above from reference #417)\n<P>A magnitude 8.0 Ms earthquake south of Sumbawa Is generated a tsunami that completely destroyed several villages. At least 100 people were killed, 89 reported missing and 75 injured. Most of the casualties and damage were caused by the tsunami. (reference #1053).\n<P>$1.2 million damage, 185 killed, 3900 homeless. (reference #1250)\n<P>On an inaccessible section of Sumbawa Is, a preliminary study indicates that the waves reached at least 15 meters above high tide, and penetrated about 500 meter inland in some valleys.

The water came back at 12h. \nAt Bisceglie the sea withdrew by 2-3 m at 6h 30m and then it flooded the beach by  200 m. The maximum height was 50 cm. Two fishing boats broke their mooring.\nAt Molfetta at 5.00 am 10 m of withdrawal. The period was 5 min. \nAnomalous oscillations also observed at Fossacesia, Vasto, Termoli, Campomarino and Trani at different times. \n\nSome newspapers report detailed description of the phenomenon:\nAt Termoli the sea withdrew for tens of metres leaving the harbour dried and then violently came back; some swimmers referred that the sea water suddenly became cold and immediately after became also turbolent and strongly agitated (Anonymous).\nAt Bari the sea water suddenly witdrew many times leaving the seafloor dried; some moored ships in the harbour went aground and some fish was found on the beach (Anonymous). \nParenzan (ref #9287) reports that at Bari and Vieste the sea suddenly withdrew for about 50-100 m leaving boats aground and after a few minutes the sea violently inundated the shore with very high waves, causing damage to the boats and some injured people. The sea water swept away the beach-umbrellas.\nIn many islands and places along the Yugoslavian coasts the sea water suddenly rose; at Vela Luka (Cursola island) the waves was 8 m high inundating the first floors of  all the buildings on the shore. Many ships suffered severe damage and the sea water flooded the cost for 650 m inland (Anonymous) \nAlso at Dubrovnick, Caltaro and at the Iissa island anomalous waves were observed (Anonymous).\n<P>(above from reference #4139)\n<P>June 22, 1978.

Six people were killed and three were lost. Numerous coastal buildings were damaged, many cars were smashed, boats that had been moored were torn away and carried off to sea. Repeated oscillations of the sea level continued for over 4 hours along a 100 km stretch of coast. The waves were not preceded by an earthquake, but an embankment 300 m long, which had been erected in the delta of the River Var\non an underwater platform, disappeared into the sea in a matter of minutes practically at the same time as the waves. It was therefore assumed that the oscillations of the sea level were caused by a powerfid underwater landslide. The collapse of the embankment alone seemed to be insufficient to generate the splash of the water observed. The bathymetric survey conducted by the\nhydrographic service and by other organisations of France revealed considerable depressions in the river bottom on the eastern edge of the underwater canyon of the River Le Paillon and on the western edge of the canyon of the River Var. A landslide of the vanished material of 400 million m<sup>3</sup> in volume could easily have caused the waves observed.

One hundred fatalities were due to the tsunami, four from the earthquake in Japan. There was extensive damage to ships, roads and houses amounting to about 800 million dollars. (reference #1315)\n<P>The earthquake generated a tsunami that began striking the Japan coast approximately 12 minutes after the earthquake occurred. One hundred lives were lost as a consequence of the tsunami alone. The tsunami also caused significant flooding and property damage to coastal\nregions. The tsunami affected the entire Japan Sea, hitting the surrounding coastline of the Korean Peninsula and the USSR. Three lives were lost in South Korea, when the wave arrived there approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake... Clearly, most of the impact occurred north\nof the Oga Peninsula, where a maximum run-up of 14.9 m was recorded... Significant wave run-up was also observed along the Korean coast... A maximum run-up of 3.2 m was followed by a run-down of -5.6 m [Port of Imweon]. Most of the impact of the tsunami in South Korea occurred between Imweon and Sogcho.. During the tsunami, 100 individuals were drowned, most of them at Noshiro, Hachimori, and the Oga Peninsula. These individuals were caught on the shoreline or on offshore construction sites. Tsunami\nwarnings were issued approximately 14 minutes after the earthquake occurred; however, the leading wave reached the shoreline at these locations at approximately the same time.\nIn Korea, three deaths were attributed to the tsunami. Since the tsunami reached the Korean shoreline approximately 1-1/2 hours after the earthquake occurred, these deaths could have been prevented... In Korea, over 70 ships were damaged by the tsunami... Many coastal flood protective structures were severely damaged during\nthe tsunami. For example, concrete armor units weighing 4 metric tons were moved hundreds of feet inland near the area of maximum run-up. In addition, many levees and seawalls were overtopped and damaged. These protective structures were designed for storm waves and were unable to accommodate the waves produced by the tsunami.

It fell down into the sea in about 10 seconds, generating a small tsunami in the bay between Point Nere and Point Luccia. This part of the island is completely uninhabited. A fisherman in a nearby boat observed the event. The positive leading wave came from Point Rioa and propagated throughout the bay. A second fisherman, who was near Point Luccia, also noticed the wave.<P>A wave of about 5.5 meters height was seen in the Porto di Levante and presumably even at Monterosa, Lipari Island. The seismometer network of the Aeolian Islands recorded the landslide vibrations. The landslide mass was estimated through models of the terrain inferred from photogrammetric campaigns carried out in 1981 and 1991. (reference #1315)\n<P>On April 20 1988 a landslide of approximately 200,000 cubic meter occurred on NE flank of volcano La Fossa on the island of Vulcano. The volcanic activity of the cone of La Fossa increased in 1987-1988 starting in June 1987, with measured ground deformations and with a seismic swarm on 9-14 August 1988. The direct cause of the slide is difficult to ascertain: the simplest hypothesis is that the mass was pushed to a critical stability point by seismic vibrations associated with the earthquake sequence affecting the region surrounding Vulcano from March to June 1988. Some other causes can be invoked, such as hot fluid circulation in the hydrothermal system (Tinti r533).\nThe landslide entered the sea generating a tsunami. Instrumental data do not exist since no tide gauges were present in the area, but the tsunami was clearly observed especially in the harbour of Porto di Levante.\nObservational data are from eyewitnesses (Tinti r533).\nA fisherman, who at the time of the landslide, was in his boat just inside the generation area, reports that at about 5:30 am local time he heard a big noise and, looking at the coast, he had the impression that the mountain was running towards him. A positive wave was excited that raised the boat without damaging it. The water wave was approximately 1-2  m high. Then he felt the boat go down, and other smaller oscillations followed the fist wave. Another boat in the same bay but further from the source, was impacted by the tsunami with no damage.\nIn the harbour of Porto di Levante many people observed sudden waves entering the harbour, similar to those produced in the sea by a storm, but the weather was fine with no wind. Wave amplitude was estimated to be approximately 0.5 m.\nInformation (not from eyewitnesses) about observed waves as 0.5m amplitude in some places on Lipari island are reported.  Tsunami intensity 2.

A MW 7.5 earthquake in the Marianas Trench near Saipan produced an observable tsunami at the Tinian dock but no damage. The Civil Defense survey did not find evidence of a tsunami at Saipan, and considered news reports of three to four meter waves at Saipan and Tinian to be greatly exaggerated. However, crewmen of the Jungle Boat on the Talofofo River, Ted,\nAndy and Lauren Fairfield told Paul Hattori that they were at the loading area at about 8:00 A.M. when they saw a\nrush of foamy sea water coming under the bridge to the loading raft going up the river. The raft rose 5 to 6 feet. The water receded to the bay after 15 minutes or longer and took the form of a strong rip current. As in 1993, debris was carried up the river for a distance of two miles. Talofofo bay is shaped to focus the water to the river mouth at the head of the bay giving a higher water level there. However, there must have been observable waves elsewhere on the northern and western coasts but this area is lightly developed and no known surveys were taken. The tsunami was not reported as having been recorded in Guam and the marigrams have not yet been located. It was recorded in Japan with heights of 26 cm at Hachi, 24 cm at Murotomisaki, 23 cm at Chichijima, 22 cm at Tosashimizu, 19 cm at Yaene, 16 cm at Mera, 15 cm at Kushimoto, 10 cm at Aburatsu, 7 cm at Owase, 6 cm at Choshi, and 4 cm at\nUchiura and Naha, in Hawaii with a height of 24 cm at Kailua-Kona, at Midway Island with a height of 6 cm, at\nWake Island with a height of 4cm, and at Truk Island with a height of 3 cm. (reference #482)\n<P>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has been routinely operating two Permanent Ocean Bottom Seismograph Systems (OBS). One was developed and installed off Cape Omaezaki in 1978 by the Meteorological Research Institute. The other was deployed by the Headquarters of JMA in 1986 off the Boso Peninsula, Kanto District. The OBS off Cape Omaezaki has four seismographs and one pressure gauge for detecting tsunamis, and another system has four seismographs and three pressure gauges. The OBS system of JMA has a long cable for transmitting signals to the station on land. On April 5,1990, another small tsunami was generated by an earthquake of Ms 7.5 near the Mariana Islands, and it was observed at many stations in Japan. We can find in the records of the OBS tsunami-meter not only sea level changes, such as tide and tsunami, but also thermally induced fluctuations and pressure variations caused by ground motion. Traces at TK1 and BSl show the ocean tide fairly well, however the ones at BS2 and Bs3 are surely deformed by thermally induced effects. Another type of thermal noise appears around eight o'clock and continued for about two hours on the records of TK1. Ground motion noise begins at the same time as the earthquake at\n6:13 on April 6, JST (9 hours ahead to Greenwich Mean Time) and continues for about two hours. This noise is larger, as the water is deeper. Tsunami waves can be seen for several hours from about ten o'clock, however the amplitudes in the deep sea are much smaller than sea level fluctuations at\nthe tide stations.

Recent field investigations showed that\ntsunami intensity generally decreases southwards and northwards relative to Bunga and Zaragoza areas. There was an unusually high tsunami wave height (~6m) at Bunga that\nwas most probably due to local site effect. Tsunami waves were generally preceded by the lowering of sea water level while the tsunami arrival times have some variation particularly in Bobon and Panompon. The period of the tsunami wave was quite difficult to determine because of sketchy details and so much variation in terms of the number of waves that attacked the areas investigated.\nIn terms of regional and local geomorphological effects, the 1992 event caused very minor changes. Tsunami sediments were dumped in very few places. It was noted that the coral reefs located between 100-250m from the shore of eastern Mindanao were the coastal features that most probably attenuate the effects tsunami.

The only historical tsunami is associated with the 12 March 1993, MW 6.4 earthquake that caused &#8764;0.5 m uplift of the reef along the southern coast of Futuna (Regnier, 1994). A small tsunami was reported along Futuna's south coast but no further observations of the wave were noted (Monzier et al., 1993; Capecchi, 1995). Immediate post-1993 earthquake studies focused on the extensive damage caused by the event including the destruction of every church greater than 100 years old. An earlier earthquake in 1840, with strong ground shaking and intense building damage, was described by the missionary station of St Pierre Chanel, but no tsunami was noted. In addition to historical records, some oral traditions provide tantalising evidence of prehistoric events that may have been catastrophic tsunamis, but age estimates are unclear (Di Piazza and Frimigacci, 1991). While sparse, the data discussed above indicate that the tsunami hazard is real, and the risk for the population who live almost exclusively along the low-lying coast is high. (reference #6956)\n<P>The shock was followed by a small tidal wave, localized at  Leava Bay, which caused extensive damage on boats who were there. On this subject, it is noted the authorities broadcasted by radio shortly after the start of the crisis, a message advising people to climb the mountain following the strong earthquake. The Futunians have fully complied with this instruction, fleeing the high part of the island after the earthquake of 13 March (the message being broadcast only Futunan, Europeans were generally not in present and therefore do not respond ...). Although in this case no significant tidal wave happened this evacuation along the coastal plain is be considered still valid in the event of strong shaking (it is not needed to stay more than 1 or 2 hours in the mountains, the tidal wave, in this case, having a local origin and thus occurring a few minutes after the earthquake).

The tsunami <B>destroyed 1,500 homes, and 278 boats</B>. The most affected districts were Lumajang, Jember, and Banyuwangi. Most of the fatalities and damage was caused by a tsunami at the villages of Pancer, Lampon, and Rajekwesi in the Banyuwangi district, the most eastern of the districts.\n<P>At Pancer, an important village situated on sand dunes of a river mouth into the bay, more than 70% of the 1,000 buildings were destroyed but only 4% (122 people) of the 3,000 inhabitants were killed, and 15 were missing. All of the straw houses were destroyed, and most of the brick buildings were severely damaged. The second wave was the largest and penetrated 300 meters inland. Palm trees\nbetween the village and the sea helped to mitigate the wave damage although most were uprooted. The maximum runup height was 9.5 meters. The wave advanced up the river causing lateral flooding. One boat was carried 60 meters inland.\n<P>Lampon, the most eastern of the villages surveyed, had a population of 700 inhabitants before the tsunami. There were 35 fatalities and 40 straw houses destroyed some of which were 500 meters inland. The wave destroyed houses 500 meters inland. Most of the damage occurred near the river where there was significant erosion. The wave penetrated one km along the river. A maximum wave height of eleven meters was measured over a steep bank.\n<P>At Rajekwesi there were 1,200 inhabitants and 300 homes. Seventy percent of the homes were built with straw. There were 33 fatalities, 14 missing, and 70 homes destroyed. Eyewitnesses reported the first wave was about one meter high, and the second wave was six to seven meters high and had an inundation of 100 meters. There was large erosion of the beach and riverbank. Palm trees near the shore were uprooted. The straw houses were leveled, and all brick buildings were damaged. \n<P>At Watuula Village of about 600 inhabitants, 16 straw houses were destroyed, three fishermen were killed, and 30 boats were severely damaged. The wave reached a height of 7.58 meters.\n<P>At Pulo Merah there were eight fatalities and 20 houses were destroyed. Many others were severely damaged. The water penetrated about 700 meters inland, carrying fish, shellfish, and stones. At the village of Puger there was no tsunami damage although the third wave penetrated 300 meters inland, about the same extent as that of large storm waves. Six fishermen who were working on the open sea were missing.\n<P>At the village of Cape Pelindu, a small fishing village of about 300 inhabitants, the maximum wave was 3.2 meters. It destroyed three homes and the wall protecting the fishery. It penetrated 350 meters inland.\n<P>A witness on the island of Bambangan reported that a tsunami from this event measured 4.6 m and that two days later a second tsunami arrived.\n<P>(above from reference #1315)\n<P>Survivors of the tsunami said the waves hit unexpectedly but recounted they heard a roaring sound as the tsunami smashed ashore.

Lobster boats spun like tops. Large lobster cars flipped over or started to drift out to sea... At around noon Tuesday, fishermen in Corea noticed unusual weather conditions: Tides seemed abnormally high, winds pounded the area, and daylight seemed to dim, then brighten again. They had just experienced what Raymond Dunbar Jr. defined as a \"bore tide\" -- a 5- to 6-foot-high wall of water. Dunbar, who was watching the storm... said he saw the tide's effect on Bruce Crowley's boat. \"It had horsed up around another one,\" he said. He saw the boat disappear. \"By that time the tide had bore out again, and she (Crowley's boat) went down out of sight and it made me think more that she had parted her mooring.\" Dwight Rodgers, manager of the Corea Co-op, said Wednesday that the tidal action was spectacular. \"There was a lot of water in the harbor and, as if somebody opened a drain, the water just disappeared,\" he said. The tidal bore created a whirlpool effect that caused some of the nearly 30 boats moored in the harbor to whip around each other. Harvey Crowley... could not believe what he saw. \"Boats were all snarled up, lobster cars were out in the middle of the harbor upside down,\" he said...  The tidal action caused one lobster car filled with lobsters to drag its two moorings. A 22-by-14-foot lobster car belonging to Dunbar's son flipped over...  Lobsterman Bruce Crowley said he noticed a difference in the tide as he watched it from his home near Corea Harbor. \"I saw the water all go out, just for a minute. It was up one minute and it was gone the next. It went fast,\" he said. Dunbar said he watched as Bruce Crowley's lobster car broke loose, headed out to sea, and then was pushed back into the harbor by a large wave. \"When that lobster car came in the second time, you couldn't row a dinghy fast enough to keep up with it. That was how fast it came up with the tide. ... It was scary,\" he said. Babe Crowley, whose home overlooks the harbor, said the tidal surge was unlike anything he had seen in his 63 years. He estimated that the wind gusted to about 80 miles per hour... (reference #9221)\n<P>Geologist explains tidal phenomenon at Corea Harbor, Bangor Daily News, January 7, 1994. Joe Kelley, director of marine geology for the Maine Geological Survey, who is based at the University of Maine, said... \"What was described in that article certainly was unusual for any area. To have water leave a harbor suddenly and then come back in suddenly as a large wave is not usual. It takes a lot of force to move water, and while there was a storm going on, that probably wasn't all of it,\"... Kelley said he had ruled out several causes. He said the event was not a tidal bore because the tides were not right. He also ruled out the possibility that the event was a tsunami... Tsunamis are related to earthquakes and a call to the Weston Geophysical Observatory in Weston, Mass., Kelley said, revealed there had been no earthquake in the North Atlantic area. The U.S. Weather Service, Kelley said, had reported that just before noon, the atmospheric pressure in Providence, R.I. dropped severely... The geologist said he believed the disturbance at Corea Harbor may have been caused by methane gas escaping from the ocean's mud bottom. He said that several years ago he had explored several methane-related holes in the sea floor in Belfast Bay [Maine]... \"What I think happened is a sudden change in the pressure raises the water level that loads the ocean floor, squeezes a bubble of (methane) gas which pushes water out and causes a wave to come into the harbor. The bubble breaks, and the water rushes back out to fill the void,\" he said. Kelly said the event apparently repeated itself several times.

It had a runup height of 0.4-0.5 meters after a withdrawal of one meter a few minutes after the earthquake for a wave height (range) of 1.5 meters. (reference #1315)\n<P>On 15 June 1995, 00:16 GMT, a strong (Ms=6.0) earthquake ruptured the western side of the Corinthos Gulf. The earthquake caused extensive damage in several towns and villages along both coastlines of the Gulf, the northern and the southern ones. The maximum intensity (VII+) was felt in the city of Aegion, southern coastline, where the collapse of two multi-storied buildings caused a death toll of 26. Extensive coastal ground breaks and subsequent ground submergence were reported in both coastlines. In the northern coastline, a local tsunami wave was officially reported from the town of Eratini (peak-to-trough 1.5 m) being located in the epicentral area. The wave was observed immediately after the earthquake occurrence. Its maximum vertical run-up was of about 004-0.5 m, while a water withdrawal of about 1 m occurred a few minutes after the earthquake. The water disturbance lasted for about 12 hours. Damage was not reported. Judging from that no tsunami was reported from other coastal places of the epicentral or more remote areas it is tentatively concluded that the wave could be attributed to the reported massive sliding in the sea of unconsolidated sediments accumulated at the local river mouth. A similar mechanism of tsunamigenesis at the same place was considered in association with the earthquake (Ms=6.3) of 6 July 1965. Tsunami generation from either seismic or aseismic sliding of coastal or submarine sediment masses is rather frequent in the Greek Archipelago, including the Gulf of Corinthos.

The initial observation from an over flight at 15:40 LT showed that the ice cover of the lake had melted and a phreatomagmatic eruption was in progress from a vent off the northern shore of the lake in a water depth of 40-50 m. Explosions occurred every 4 to 12 minutes. Six explosions were observed with an average interval of 6 minutes between them. Between explosions the lake water displayed intensive bubbling and steaming. The strongest explosions produced a rapidly rising, smooth-surfaced bulb-like mass of expanding gas and pyroclastics. This bulb grew to a height of 450 m, and then it began to collapse as jets of black pyroclastics mixed with steam pierced the shell. A light gray \"collar\" appeared around the center of the explosion about 130 m high. This collar propagated radialy about 20 to 40 m/s to form a tsunami. Meanwhile the pyroclastic jets reached their maximum height of 1 km and collapsed back into the lake to produce a base surge. The interaction between the base surge and the lake water contributed to the formation of complex waves. \n<P>\nThe steep northern shore of the lake was violently eroded by the tsunamis and surges, with all plants and soil less than 1.5 m thick stripped off, and poorly consolidated bedrock exposed. Along the rest of the shoreline, more than 1.3 km from the crater, the tsunamis carved new cliffs two to three\nmeters high, eroded the layer of frozen soil up to 50 cm thick, and removed the vegetation.

Breaking waves were also reported at about half of the sites. Three waves were observed. The wave penetrated as much as 200 meters up riverbeds and carried five boats including two 500-ton motorboats 250 meters on shore.

A magnitude Ms 7.1 earthquake occurred near the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea 850 km northwest of Port Moresby, the capitol of Papua New Guinea (PNG). The earthquake, which occurred at 6:49 P.M. local time, was followed by a series of three catastrophic tsunami waves that devastated the villages of Sissano, Warupu, Arop (1 & 2) and Malol on the north coast of PNG killing at least 2,182, injuring 1,000, and displacing more than 10,000.<P>The earthquake was felt widely in PNG coastal communities. In the Aitape region, it was reportedly strong enough to make walking difficult and to knock objects over. The main shock was followed 20 min later by two moderate aftershocks that occurred so close together that they appeared to be a single event.<P>The three waves affected a 40-km length of coastline from the mouth of the Bliri River on the west to the town of Aitape on the east. This length of coastline was home to around 15,000 people before the tsunami. The area is predominantly tropical swamp landa home to tribes that rely on subsistence farming and fishing and live in beach homes made of local materials. This section of coastline was particularly vulnerable because a narrow strip of land separates the ocean from Sissano Lagoon, a lagoon formed by a tsunami in 1907.<P>At many locations along this stretch of coastline the first wave arrived about 20 min. after the main shock (just after the first aftershocks). The trough of the first wave arrived soon after dark accompanied by loud sounds that drew curious tribesmen to the beach where they viewed the exposed sea floor. This was followed by an air blast that reportedly knocked people off their feet and a 7 to 10-meter tsunami crest. At Warupu and the Arop villages the second crest was described as riding on the back of the first and breaking over the villages, sweeping debris over the spit and washing it into the lagoon or 500 m inland from the coast. Trees were uprooted, and mature mangroves were broken off at distances of 1,300 m from the shore. Maximum wave heights reached nearly 15 m along a 20-km stretch of the lagoon area.<P>The villages of Arop and Warupu were entirely destroyed.<i><blockquote>Ref #11882</i></blockquote>In 1998, the official estimate of deaths resulting from the tsunami was just over 2,200. Working back from the names listed on the memorials that were erected a year later, on 17 July 1999, authorities have been able to <B>confirm 1,636 deaths</B> (written communication from Tom Ritchie). The difference between the two figures remains unexplained. A further 1,000 were treated for serious wounds (p.48).\n<i><blockquote>Ref #2707</i></blockquote>The death toll of the Aitape tsunami disaster has been confirmed at 2,182 as of 7 August 1998 while over 500 people are still missing. Major human damage are reported from three villages on sandbar of Sissano lagoon. Almost damage caused by the tsunami. Number of dead and missing is over 2,000. The population before the disaster was about 6,600 and the casualty reached a third of the population. Especially, over two thirds of the people were dead in Arop and Wrapu. The damage of this tsunami concentrated there. These two villages locate on a sand spit of Sissano Lagoon. Sissano Lagoon is 10 km in length, 3 km in width and 2 to 3 m in depth. It was made by the 1907 earthquake. Because the sand spit is 100 to 200 m in width and 2.5 to 3 m in height houses on this sand spit could be washed out easily by the tsunami. Its building was destroyed and only its foundation remained. The average maximum heights of the tsunami waves they crossed the Sissano sandbar was about 10 m. However, the wave height varies at different points long the sandbar and was as high as 15 m above the sea level at the former site of the Arop village. In this 1.2km long sector of the sandbar nothing was left standing now. There was a complete stripping of structures and trees." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 142.582, -2.943 ] } },

Another two who were pulled out to sea were never recovered and are presumed dead. <P>The Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific correctly did not issue a warning because the earthquake's magnitude was below the threshold for such a warning, and indeed, there was no destructive tsunami in the far field. (all above from Reference #2673)\n<P>Vanuatu consists of an island arc formed by the subduction of the Australian plate under the Pacific plate (Figure 2B). Vanuatu is seismically active, with magnitude 5-6 events common, especially in the Central Basin area bounded by Espiritu Santo and Malakula on the west, and Maewo and Pentecost on the east. A magnitude 6.4 event occurred in the central basin in 1965, followed the next day by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Epi. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake also occurred in 1981 south of Malakula. Because of Vanuatus steep topography, landslides commonly accompany earthquakesthese landslides may also occur offshore. Wong and Greene (1988) noted many large submarine landslides in the Central Basin that could have triggered tsunamis. Previous tsunamis occurred in 1875 (Vanuatu), 1961 (south of Efate), and 1965, which saw two tsunamis a day apart (the first in the Central Basin, and the second near Epi) (Wong and Greene, 1988). It is likely that most tsunamis in the region go unreported simply because the population is so spread out, and because small tsunamis might strike only uninhabited coast. Both the Harvard and USGS solutions for the 26 November 1999 earthquake are not located on the plate boundary, but are close to a large reverse fault (Louat and Pelletier, 1989) in the back-arc. The fault is segmented by transverse faults associated with Vanuatus active volcanoes. Because the aftershocks are contained within the area bounded by the Aoba and Ambrym transverse faults (Figure 2B), the Harvard solution for the earthquake seems more likely than the USGS solution (which is located in a different fault segment). The Harvard earthquake rupture mechanism shows the failure plane striking at 20 degrees, with a high angle (62 degrees) dip to the east. This mechanism seems consistent with movement on a splay of the large reverse fault of Louat and Pelletier. The tsunami generated by this earthquake caused damage throughout central Vanuatu (Figure 2C). Eyewitnesses uniformly reported three damaging waves, lead by a leading depression wave, as also occurred during the 1992 Flores, 1994 East Java, 1994 Mindoro and 1996 Irian Jaya tsunamis (Imamura et al., 1996).

Run up heights on open coast were generally less than 1 m, but reached 1.5 m at Kauk and an estimated \n3-4 m in west-facing bays on the islands, and on the mainland coast immediately east of Boiken.\nThe higher run-up in the west-facing bays was a funneling effect. In both Victoria Bay and Mushu Bay, the larger of the west-facing bays on Mushu Island, observers saw the water circulate counter clockwise around the perimeter of the bay, and reach maximum height in the eastern extremity of each bay. Logs were washed ashore amongst the houses at Buruwan on Victoria Bay and 50 m of land was inundated. Logs, coral and a moored dinghy were washed ashore in Mushu Bay. The reason for the higher run-up east of Boiken is less clear, but perhaps was due to the funneling of the tsunami between the coast and the islands. Tsunami effects were observed as far east as Murik Lakes; where water washed through the villages at ankle depth. The villages are on a low sand bar. In the west, a repeated rising and falling of the water level in the Aitape River of the order of 1 m above normal water level was observed at 6.45 to 7 am. In Wewak too, there was a fluctuation of the sea level at 6:45-7 am, the water draining out into the bay then returning passively to flood across the road, before subsiding to normal level. The drop in sea level was estimated to be 2 m, and the rise above normal sea level, 1.5-2 m.

In the area of maximum damage from earthquake shaking, between Boiken and the mouth of Hawain River, the tsunami was reported to have had turbulent, violent flow.

It generated a tsunami that \"caused severe destruction in the [Stromboli] island, produced some damage in the Aeolian archipelago, and was observed in several coastal places in the south-Tyrrhenian sea\" (Reference #2439).\n<P>On 30 December at 1315 and 1322 two landslides suddenly formed along the Sciara del Fuoco. As they traveled down the volcano's flank they produced wet, fine ashfall (less than 0.1 mm in size) on the island's SE side. The first landslide had a volume of about 600,000 m3, the second about 5,000,000 m3, and they both reached the sea. Upon contact with the sea the landslides produced two tsunamis with waves that were several meters high. The tsunamis injured few people, and damaged buildings and boats in the villages of Stromboli and Ginostra. Large waves were reported as far away as the town of Milazzo, on Sicily's N coast, 60 km S of Stromboli... According to several news articles, volcanic activity at Stromboli on 30 December caused a landslide, which entered the sea and generated a tsunami. The articles stated that in the small village of Ginostra, waves injured six people, and damaged homes and boats. Residents and tourists were evacuated to nearby Sicily. (reference #2432)\n<P>During the last months of 2002 Stromboli was dominated by an intense explosive activity that lasted till December 28. On that day Stromboli started a new effusive phase that compromised the stability of the Sciara del Fuoco flank leading to the landslides of December 30. It has been ascertained that two different landslides occurred in that day. The first one occurred at 13:15 and it was mainly a submarine one, whereas the second one, occurred 7-8 min later and produced a subaerial scar on the Sciara del Fuoco at a height of 500 m a.s.l., for a volume of about 7-8 million cubic meters. The mass moved by the first landslide was much greater than the sub-aerial one, and bathymetric surveys revealed that the total volume of the material moved by the two slides was about 20 million cubic meters. According to Tinti both landslides produced tsunami waves: the first event was characterized by a first negative sea movement, while the second produced a positive wave. The submarine slide caused a sea level lowering of about 10-15 m at the foot of the Sciara, immediately propagating in both directions, northward towards Piscità and southward towards Ginostra. A destructive tsunami, starting with an initial slow withdrawal, violently invested the northern coasts of  the island with three-four big waves. It has been ascertained that within a few minutes the water invaded Ficogrande beach, and attacked Punta Lena and Scari producing severe damage. The second tsunami was generated around 13:22 by a subaerial mass failure. Only a few people were able to distinguish the arrival of the second tsunami and to recognize the positive leading wave, while most considered it as the continuation of the first. Several field surveys were undertaken soon after the event both in the near and far-field. The strongest tsunami effects were observed at Stromboli. In the beach called Spiaggia Longa (north-eastern coast) the highest value of runup (10.90 m) was measured. At Piscità the buildings located near the shore were seriously damaged.

It was recorded on tide gauges at Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Nice, France; and Genoa, Italy. The tsunami was also observed on the coast of Alicante, Castellon and Murcia, Spain. (reference #1053)\n<P>Observed tsunami waves of up to 3-m height with a mean period of 10-12 minutes were reported on the southeastern coast of Majorca and Menorca, and in Ibiza in the Spanish Balearic Islands located about 250 km north of the epicentral region. The waves caused significant damage to hundreds of vessels in harbors and ports. On the Algerian coast in the epicentral region, eyewitness accounts report a 100-m recession of the sea in coastal sections of Algiers and Boumerdes, and fishermen in the port of Zemmouri-El-Bahri, reported a drop in water depth to less than 1 m with several boats ending up resting on the sea bottom before the water returned.

(reference #3025)\n<P>The destructive Zemmouri earthquake of 2003 May 21 (Mw 6.8) occurred at 18:44 (GMT) along the coast, 50 km east of the city of Algiers, between the cities of Zemmouri and Boumerdès. This shock, the largest felt in this region since the 1716 event, had the epicenter  located very close to the coast (about 4 km) and the earthquake produced severe damage and more than 2,000 victims. Two main phenomena were associated to the earthquake: shoreline uplift along 50 km and a tsunami, triggered either by the earthquake itself or by a submarine landslide. According to Dr. Yelles, director of the CRAAG center in Algiers, the tsunami waves were generated by a river sediment slide. In fact, the area is well known for a large sediment deposited by a river, a deposit which is highly unstable. Instantaneously with the Zemmouri earthquake, a tsunami was generated along the northern Algerian coasts. No run-up values were reported along the Algerian coasts, indicating that the tsunami waves, if any, were not high enough to inundate beyond original shoreline. \n(reference #4139)\n<P>A strong tsunami with sea disturbances observed along the Algerian coast, but with significant damage mainly in the Balearic Islands (Spain) harbours, affected the western Mediterranean following the 2003 Zemmouri earthquake (MW 6.9, Algeria).

Field observations, main shock and aftershocks characteristics are consistent with thrust along a &#8764;55-km-long rupture, trending NESW, dipping SE. The seismotectonic parameters indicate a hypocentre 78 km deep and a possible fault break between 5 and 15 km offshore. Several tide gauges located in the western Mediterranean Coast indicated an average of 0.4 m of sea-level change with a maximum of 2 m in the Balearic Islands.

(ref #1053)\n<P>This was a slow earthquake, meaning that the rupture occurred more slowly and took longer than in a normal earthquake. Slow earthquakes usually occur at very shallow depths and produce greater displacements than normal earthquakes. As a consequence, they are more likely to significantly displace the seabed and generate tsunamis. In addition, the magnitude of slow earthquakes may be underestimated by traditional magnitude calculations because the energy they radiate is deficient in high frequencies due to the slower rupture speed. Further, the strongest energy release of the earthquake may occur minutes after the initial rupture and thus not be captured by the initial magnitude calculation. This event was also called a tsunami earthquake, which is an earthquake that generates a tsunami much larger than expected given the earthquake magnitude. Tsunami earthquakes are often caused by slow earthquakes. According to a ReliefWeb report, on 19 July, Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla announced that the death toll had reached 525 with 273 people missing. Most damage centred on the town of Pangandaran. More than 50,000 people were evacuated. (ref #9200)\n<P>802 killed, 35,543 affected, $55 million damage.

In the heavily damaged area of Pangandaran, the estimated run-up heights from eyewitness accounts is 4 to 6 m. Along the southwest shore of Pangandaran National Park, which is a small spit that extends about a kilometer to the south, the tsunami was relatively small. From observations of markers consisting of lines of sands and leaves, the tsunami did not appear very highabout 1 to 2 m.

(reference #1053) \n<P>The earthquake in the Region of Aysen generated landslides between the Island Mentirosa and Ri'o Cuervo, generating a mass of earth that fell into the sea causing waves of great size that affected the coastal sectors and the salmon plants of the fiord of Aysen. Three people were killed and seven are missing. (ref #2684)\n<P>The earthquake produced a landslide in the fjord area close to Puerto Chacabuco. The landslide generated 3 waves, the biggest was about 6 meters and affected a local area. A tide gauge recorded only a 0.8 m. variation (10 km away from the landslide). (ref #2686)\n<P>On 21 April 2007, an Mw 6.2 earthquake produced an unforeseen chain of events in the Aysen fjord (Chilean Patagonia, 45.5 S). The earthquake triggered hundreds of subaerial landslides along the fjord flanks. Some of the landslides eventually involved a subaqueous component that, in turn, generated a series of displacement wavestsunami- like waves produced by the fast entry of a subaerial landmass into a water bodywithin the fjord. These waves, with run-ups several meters high along the shoreline, caused 10 fatalities. In addition, they severely damaged salmon farms, which constitute the main economic activity in the region, setting free millions of cultivated salmon with still unknown ecological consequences... The combined results from all of these studies show that the large destructive waves were likely generated by the concurrent effects of the entry of subaerial landslides into the water body, the subaqueous destabilization of the fjord flanks linked to coastline retreat, and the sudden generation of the compressional ridges, which implied a vertical displacement of the fjord floor of up to 15 meters. (ref #10839)\n<P>April 1 (Ms 5,4) which triggered a small tsunami and caused some minor damages to the salmon farms near the epicentral zone.

The displaced waters left marks by direct impact of up to 50 m in the northern part of the Isla Mentirosa.

Full, mature, strong cedar trees just got uprooted and thrown around like matchsticks.\" The wave, which officials estimated was several metres high, demolished trees several metres above the normal waterline, leaving only bare rock ringing the lake. \"Very impressive in terms of the power of nature--beautiful and terrifying at the same time,\" Penner said. A number of campsites along the lake were badly damaged by the wave, but nobody was in the area at the time.

The maximum wave amplitude was three meters, and\nthe sea oscillations lasted for several hours. The anomalous\nbehaviour was seen in many places of the coast of Bulgaria\nand was stronger in the north. Several accounts of\neyewitnesses as well as reports of local port authorities\nand three tide-gauge recordings are available and have been\ncollected and analysed. The tsunami could have been\nproduced by a submarine landslide or by atmospheric\npressure pulses. Here, we explore the former hypothesis,\ni.e., the possibility that the tsunami was induced by a\nlandslide that may have occurred on the shelf margin off\nBulgaria. By making use of numerical modelling we find\nthat submarine mass movements taking place within a\ncertain delimited source area off Bulgaria may have\ngenerated tsunamis compatible with the observations... The anomalous behaviour of the sea started around 9:009:30 am (Local Time) on 7 May 2007 and lasted with progressive attenuation for about 5 hours. Direct observations were made mostly in the two biggest towns of the coast - Balchik and Kavarna (about 13000 inhabitants each). The port authorities reported similar effects to the north, near Kaliakra cape and the village of Shabla. Slightly more to the south, the observations were documented by observers at the Varna port and the Galata oil and gas platform. The oscillations were recorded by two sea level analogue mareographs, one in Varna and one in Ahtopol (the southernmost point of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast) operated by NIGiF (Scientific Research for Geodesy and Photogrammetry, Sofia).\n<P>The tsunami caused only slight damage in the affected\nareas. In Kavarna, a 2530 ton tourist boat was rotated\nviolently according to his captain and was damaged near the\nanchor holes and in some other parts, including the rudder.\nMany small fishing boats were cast onto the beach in\nKavarna and Balchik Marinas.

At the latitude of the earthquake of September 29, 2009, the Pacific plate moves westward with respect to the interior of the Australia plate at a velocity of about 86 mm/year. The earthquake occurred near the northern end of a 3,000 km long segment of the Pacific/Australia plate boundary that trends north-northeast; farther north of the earthquakes source region, the plate boundary trends northwest and then west. The eastern edge of the broad Australia plate may be viewed as a collection of small plates or microplates that move with respect to each other and with respect to the Pacific plate and the Australia plate interior.\n<P>On the basis of currently available location and fault mechanism information, we infer that the September 29 earthquake occurred as a normal fault rupture on or near the outer rise of the subducting Pacific plate.\n<P>The broad-scale Australia/Pacific plate boundary is one of the most active earthquake regions in the world.

Preliminary measures of a Rapid Survey Team deployed the week after the event by UNESCO showed run-up measurements as high as 30 m with most common measurements between 6 and 10 m in the most affected area of the Chilean coast. (reference #9405)<P>The tsunami is believed responsible for much of the deaths and damage. The magnitude-8.8 quake - one of the strongest on record - and the tsunami that followed ravaged a 435-mile stretch of Chile's Pacific coast. In the coastal town of Constitucion, firefighters were looking for bodies of people swept away by the tsunami as they camped on Isla Orrego, an island in the mouth of the Maure River that flows through the city. Constitucion suffered perhaps the greatest loss of life in the disaster, in part because many people had come for carnival celebrations and were caught in huge waves that reached the central plaza. \"There were about 200 people in tents who disappeared\" on Isla Orrego, Fire Chief Miguel Reyes told The Associated Press. (ref. #6836)<P>Yet a large wave crashed later into the Chilean islands of Juan Fernandez, killing at least 8 people and leaving another 8 missing, the emergency office said. (ref. #6810)<P>While the Pacific basin was spared a major tsunami, there was major tsunami damage in Chile. In the coastal city of Talcahuano, where the surge reached nearly 5 m from peak to trough, a bizarre exchange took place: While even larger boats landed in the city centre, entire homes floated out to sea. 'The water swept aside everything that got in its way,' said a resident of the small town of Boyecura. A wall of water swept across the Chilean island of Robinson Crusoe, 670 km off the coast, destroying many buildings and sweeping 5 people out to sea. Eleven others were missing. The Chilean Navy admitted it failed to give adequate tsunami warning to Robinson Crusoe, which lies in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez. (ref. #6811)<P>Islanders in the Chilean archipelago of Juan Fernandez felt a slight tremor early Saturday, one just like any other of those they hardly take notice of, and they slept on. Over the course of the morning, they saw on television the damage that the massive quake had caused in the city of Concepcion and elsewhere on the southern Chilean mainland. And then officials started waiting for information about a possible tsunami, but it ever came. Instead, as they saw the sea starting to rise, they rushed to switch on the sirens - but it was too late for some. The tsunami killed 5 people on the island, while 14 remained missing a day later, a toll that may have been avoided had the tsunami-detection and warning mechanisms been in order, some say. Upon hearing the sirens, some of the 629 residents of the village of Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Is ran to the hills with no time for salvage. A wall of water - possibly nearly 5 metres high - ravaged everything in its way. Within a few minutes, the scene of the adventures of Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk - marooned on the island from 1704 to 1708, and immortalized in Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe - had been razed to the ground. \"Everything that had been along that three-km stretch just disappeared,\" said Fernando Avaria, the first pilot to fly over the area after the disaster. The cemetery, the churches, sports facilities and the area's only school were reduced to planks of wood and broken glass. The buildings of the local authority simply disappeared. \"It was devastating, really out of a horror film,\" said Margot Salas, a local who toured the area with Chilean state television cameras almost 24 hours after the disaster. As the sea receded, Robinson Crusoe Is faced a new flood - one of despair. Mud covered everything within 3 km of the coast.

(reference #10738)\n<P>Underwater landslide likely cause of 'mild tsunami', 29 June 2011 Last updated at 06:33 ET. BBC News article. A \"mild tsunami\" along the South West coast was probably caused by an underwater landslide, a coastal expert has said. The unusual tidal surge struck the Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Hampshire coastline on Monday morning. There were reports of rivers changing direction, fish leaping out of water and hair standing on end due to static... Roland Stewart from Millbrook, near Plymouth, said: \"It was quite violent in a way, my dinghy was moving around with the movement of the water and I just wondered what the hell was going on.... within 15 minutes it was all over.\".. Dr Davidson, an associate professor in coastal processes, told BBC Spotlight: \"[Surges] are quite rare and it's probably not a tidal phenomenon. \"It's probably more likely to be a tsunami of some kind, obviously it's quite mild. \"It's probably not due to an earthquake, which is the normal source. \"It's probably more likely to be a sub-marine landslide.\" According to the Tidal Gauge Anomaly measure, which records the difference between the forecast tide and the actual tide, the anomaly on Monday morning in Newlyn, Cornwall was 0.2m (0.7ft), in Plymouth 0.3m (1ft) and in Portsmouth 0.4m (1.3ft). The MET Office in Exeter said it did not think anything in the weather could have caused the change in the tidal pattern. The British Geological Survey said there was no seismic activity in UK waters over the weekend. (reference #9478)" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -3.0, 50.5 ] } },

The epicenter, as reported by the US Geological Survey (USGS), was located approximately 75 km due south of the El Salvador coastline (Fig. 1). Approximately 50 aftershocks with magnitudes between 5.5 and 4.2 occurred in the vicinity of the main event between 27 August and 11 September 2012. The initial assessment of the earthquake by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) determined that the earthquake was significant due to the strength of the seismic signal and the long-period nature of the initial seismic waves. Within 10 min of the main shock, additional analysis by the PTWC suggested that the earthquake could be characterized as a slow earthquake.\n<P>The strongest tsunami effects were experienced along the central section of the San Juan del Gozo Peninsula. At the time of the earthquake (*10:37 p.m.) it was relatively dark with a quarter moon low over the horizon and a moonset near 1 a.m. The earthquake occurred just after high tide when scores of people were present on the beach collecting sea turtle eggs for conservation projects. A worker at one of the hatcheries was in a ramada (a small shed with wooden posts, and walls and roof made from aluminum siding) located on the beach at the crest of the dunes approximately 70 m from the water when the earthquake occurred. This witness came out of the ramada when he heard people crying out and was subsequently caught in the wave and dragged some 90 m inland where he was ultimately suspended in a tree branch at a height of 2.1 m above the ground. This witness reported that there were three tsunami waves and that the flow depth at the ramada was just below the roof (approx. 2.5 m). During the tsunami, the walls of the ramada were torn off of the posts that are deeply embedded in the sand; the posts themselves were not pulled out of the ground, but some were pushed over by the force of the water. Other witnesses related similar stories, and in total there were more than 40 injured people, with three injuries requiring medical attention." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -88.59, 12.139 ] } },

It has been there since 1740 and now is Greenlands most popular tourist destination thanks to the gorgeous Ilulissat Icefjord (tourism is the towns principal industry). All of which brings us to Jens Muller who is a Greenland native but from another community.\nHe recently posted a most interesting video of an event that happened on a beautiful, sunny day in Greenland; an event that easily could have cost him and two others their lives. Jens picks it up from there. A tourist from Australia came to my uncle and asked if she could get a ride to the glacier just north of Ilulissat, Greenland, so he asked me if I wanted to be his translator. I am from another town where glaciers are fairy tales, I was as much of a tourist as the Australian tourist, so I decided to join the crew. The beautiful scenery was amazing, but the nature doesn't care about anyone. That day almost became our last day. So it was Jens, his uncle and the Australian tourist in the small boat that drove out to the big glacier that everyone wants to see. The glacier flows at a rate of 65 to 115 feet per day, resulting in around 20 billion tons of icebergs calving off and passing out of the fjord every year. Icebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large (up to 3,300 feet in height) that they are too tall to float down the fjord and instead lay stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. As Jens was filming the glacier and the beauty of the surroundings, that is when it happened. A massive portion of the glacier calved off and dropped into the sea; a big enough piece that it generated a huge wave.\n(reference #9925)\n<P>It's unclear when the footage was shot but it was uploaded yesterday [July 19, 2012] by a man from Greenland who goes by the username Barbecueengineer.

The mound appears to be 20 to 40 feet (6 to 12 m) high and 100 feet (30 m) wide, DIG Gwadar Moazzam Jah, a district police officer, told Pakistan's Geo News. It rose out of the sea at a spot located about 350 feet (100 m) from the coast, he said...  A mud volcano is a likely possibility because Gwadar's coastline already has several of the gurgling, steamy cones, both onshore and at sea... And in 1945, the magnitude-8.1 Makran temblor triggered the formation of mud volcanoes offshore of Gwadar, according to a study on mud volcanoes in Pakistan published in 2005. A recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience also suggests the 1945 earthquake released tons of methane from the seafloor...But Geologist Dave Petley, a landslide expert, thinks the island's low, arcuate (or bow) shape  as seen in the few pictures released so far  suggests a rotational landslide, rather than a conical mud volcano.(reference #10751)\n<P>Three tide gauges and one DART station in the Arabian Sea observed the tsunami. (reference #10750)\n<P>A mud volcano caused an island which measured approximately 76 m long, 30 m wide and 18 m high to form in the Arabian Sea about 600 meters off the coast near Gwadar, Pakistan. A tsunami was recorded with the following maximum wave heights: 0.17 m at Chah Bahar and 0.09 m at Jask, Iran; 0.26 m at Muscat, Oman. (reference #1053)\n<P>This earthquake triggered a tsunami that was recorded by various sea-level tide gauges along the coastal regions of the Arabian Sea and tsunami buoys in the Arabian Sea[...]The sudden uplift of the mud island might have caused the tsunami generation, which was clearly mapped by the backward ray tracing technique in this case study. The sudden uplift of mud island or submarine slumping might have caused the tsunami generation,which could be clearly mapped by the backward ray tracing technique as admissible tsunamigenic source. (reference #12691)\n<P>The modest tsunami recorded at the buoy and at Muscat (Oman)and Chah Bahar (Iran) was generated not by slip on the megathrust or a related splay fault but on a fault within the Makran accretionary prism, which is being shortened and uplifted by subduction.

The estimated 200 million metric tons of rock spilled onto the toe of Tyndall Glacier and into Taan Fjord, in Icy Bay, Alaska. This landslide produced a tsunami that was recorded at two NOS tide gages monitored by the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC). (reference #11514)\n<P>An approximately 100-m high landslide generated tsunami flooded the coastline of Taan Fiord in SW Alaska on October 17, 2015. Inundation reached 190 m at its highest point, and exceeded 50 m along over 10 km of coastline. Within the area of inundation, several alluvial fans provided both a source and depositional setting for sediment transported by the tsunami, and each fan is blanketed by tens of cm to meters of sediment. During a month of fieldwork in spring and summer of 2016, we sampled and documented these deposits. Where the wave was largest near the tsunami source, the deposit has two distinct layers: A) a basal layer with very poorly sorted sediment ranging from sand to boulders and B) an overlying layer composed of relatively well sorted cobbles and boulders where interstitial spaces are open except at the base of this layer, where they are packed with sand. Flattened vegetation at the base of layer A indicates the lower deposit formed during inrush. Channeling and small fan-like features in layer B suggest it formed during tsunami return flow. Farther towards the mouth of the fjord, where the tsunami was only a fraction of the initial height, two fans preserve a similar poorly sorted basal layer that was in many places overlain with boulders and/or sand. The thickness of the deposit and its consistency across multiple fans along the fjord suggest both that similar deposits could be indicators of paleo landslide-generated tsunamis, and that deposit stratigraphy from these kinds of events may record useful information about a tsunamis size and character. (reference #11717)\n<P>On 17 October 2015, an estimated 60 × 106m3 rockmass (Haeussler et al., 2017; Higman et al., submitted for publication) detached from as high as ~850 m above sea level at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier (Figs. 1, 3), a site of previous landsliding (Meigs et al., 2006). Approximately 90% of the mass entered directly into the fjord, creating a tsunami with runup of up to 192 m (Higman et al., submitted for publication). Some debris re-emerged from the fjord on the opposite shore of Taan Fiord and on the eastern moraine, where it formed hummocky deposits typical of large landslides. Such re-emergence of debris onto land after travel throughwater has, to our knowledge, not been described before. A small portion of the landslide debris (~3%) slid onto Tyndall Glacier and a larger slide block remained within the source area (~7%). (reference #12007)\n<P>Glacial retreat in recent decades has exposed unstable slopes and allowed deep water to extend beneath some of those slopes. Slope failure at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier on 17 October 2015 sent 180 million tons of rock into Taan Fiord, Alaska.

Later Sunday morning, police said that four people missing and 11 buildings were washed into the sea by the tsunami. Arctic Command published pictures of the mountain at Karrat Ice Fjord, where there has been a huge shift. An area of about 300 times 1100 meters crashed into the sea. According Arctic Command it is probably the cause of the tsunami on Saturday night. (ref #11830)\n<P>Tuesday afternoon informs Greenland Police that the four missing from the disaster at the weekend presumed dead.There is a family of two adults and a child. Additionally assumed an elderly man died, says Greenland Police KNR. (ref #11831)\n<P>Initially, based on seismic signals, it appeared as if a M=4.1 earthquake caused the slide. However, in the aftermath of the event, scientists have examined the event more carefully, and have now determined that there was no earthquake. Instead, the landslide was so large that it generated significant seismic energy. Two clues that led scientists to see that there had in fact been no earthquake were the duration and characteristic of the seismic signals. Not only did the seismic waves last for approximately five minutes, but they were monochromatic and slowly increased in amplitude (the highest amplitude waves lasted about 30 seconds). Such traits, according to the IRIS blog, authored by John Clinton (ETH Zurich), Tine Larsen, Trine Dahl-Jensen, Peter Voss (GEUS Copenhagen), and Meredith Nettles (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University) are indicative of complex landslide signals. (ref #11836)\n<P>The team, including the acclaimed environmental scientist Hermann Fritz, has estimated that the wave at the coast where the landslide struck reached a marked 90 meters altitude. It is more than twice as high as the Round Tower. On the opposite side of the fjord, the height according to the researchers was 50 meters.

The upper extent of the release area was at over 1200- m elevation, and the main body of the rock avalanche source was 800 m across and reached over 300-m thickness in places.

Differential digital elevation models (DEMs) estimate a landslide volume of 3551 million cubic meters. The landslide triggered a tsunami that washed up in a remote region near the village of Nuugaatsiaq, reportedly killing four people, injuring dozens, and washing away eleven homes (Bessette-Kirton et al., 2017).

There is an interesting observation that no damage happened in the next bay (Bitez bay at West and Bodrum marina at East of Gumbet bay) which indicates that main impacts of tsunami localized in Gumbet bay. According to the analysis of the records of a security camera at easternmost end of Gumbet bay, sea receded 5 minutes after the earthquake and advanced up to 60m inundation at 13th minute. The run-up traces were found at 2 m elevation (not the inundation border) at Karaada-Black Island (27.461422E, 36.966323N) Kucuk Poyraz bay which is facing the tsunami source area at the epicenter. The tsunami has also been observed at Akyaka village at the eastern end of Gokova bay 80 km away from the epicenter. In Kos, the maximum amplitude of ~1.5 m was observed in the old port of the town, as it comes out from eyewitness accounts, tsunami traces left behind and the analysis of security camera video. In the coast outside the Kos port the tsunami heights did not exceed ~1.0 m. This event occurred in a small area and showed unexpected run-up distribution in the near field area which indicates that the tsunami triggering mechanism is not homogeneous.

The Harbour Master's Office provided some boats for the eventuality of a transfer of people. The island has also been banned from recreational boat traffic. Scheduled transfers, on the other hand, are guaranteed. \n<P>Besides the activation of the whole system, the volunteers on the island are constantly informing the population about the situation and the preventive measures to adopt.
